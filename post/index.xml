      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another&lt;/strong&gt; timely dispatch from your man in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of November’s election, Trump took heavy fire from the press for claiming his Electoral College victory over Clinton was the largest “since Reagan.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article from Vox, headlined &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/16/14639058/trump-electoral-college-win&#34;&gt;Trump keeps lying about his Electoral College victory&lt;/a&gt;, is typical of the pushback. It compares, unfavorably, Trump’s Electoral College total to those of his recent predecessors. Trump received 304 (306, minus two faithless electors) out of 538 electoral votes, which is less than:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama’s 332 in 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama’s 365 in 2008&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Clinton’s 379 in 1996&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Clinton’s 370 in 1992&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;and George H. W. Bush’s 426 in 1988&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While those numbers are clear, they are also a poor metric for the magnitude of Trump’s win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say that because in any election year, only a minority of all electoral votes are up for grabs. The majority will go to one candidate or the other purely because of their party affiliation. No political fortune or failure will change that. That Trump won Tennessee’s 11 votes had nothing to do with his merits as a candidate, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, and because most states apportion their votes in winner-take-all fashion, a presidential election can be reduced the outcomes of a relative handful of states: the “swing states” where both candidates spend the bulk of their time and money. To see how well the candidates fared, you have to focus on these states and discount the states where the result was a foregone conclusion. That allows you to evaluate the outcome independent of the fact that both Democrats and Republicans currently have 160+ guaranteed electoral votes baked into the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of argument I’ll say that a swing state is one where in the final vote, the major parties finished within 10 percentage points of each other. Or put another way, one where the loser needed five points or fewer to flip the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering only those states, here are the presidential election results &amp;ldquo;since Reagan&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Year&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;Rep. Votes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;Dem. Votes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;Winner&amp;rsquo;s Margin&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1988&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;168&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;96&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;+26%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1992&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;133&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;127&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;-2%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1996&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;124&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;127&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;+1%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;125&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;+12%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2004&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;103&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;160&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;-22%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2008&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;53&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;106&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;+33%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2012&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;42&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;141&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;+54%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2016&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;178&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;+66%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this metric Trump’s win &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; the biggest since Reagan! I believe this also explains why it seemed big: Trump got an outsized share of the swing states, which dominate the discussion of electoral results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this approach underrate strong winners (who are more likely to win by &amp;gt;10%) and overrate weak winners (who have more close calls)? Maybe, but I expect that effect to be net-neutral, as strong winners should also flip more close states into their column and away from their opponents. It also might &lt;strong&gt;over&lt;/strong&gt;rate weak losers, like Bob Dole in 1996, whose total above includes 32 electoral votes from Texas, which he only won by 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other anomaly to note is that John Kerry in 2004 won California by 9.95%, so it counts toward his total. Less California&amp;rsquo;s 55 votes, the numbers for 2004 are 103–105 against Bush, reflecting the close overall result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a more telling and certainly more interesting way to compare presidential elections across time than raw electoral vote totals. Also it was tedious as hell and I understand why those churning out grist for content mills like Vox wouldn&amp;rsquo;t bother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this said, I still rate the original claim, that Trump won by an historic margin, four pants-on-fire out of five (🔥👖🔥👖🔥👖🔥👖 / 5) because saying “an historic” is obviously wrong, “a” is the proper article there and nobody worth listening to thinks otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Did Senate Republicans Steal Obama&#39;s Nomination?</title>
      <link>/2017/04/11/did-senate-republicans-steal-obamas-nomination/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2017 08:51:26 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2017/04/11/did-senate-republicans-steal-obamas-nomination/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Keeping with my preference to stay a step behind the news cycle, I’d like to discuss the claim that Senate Republicans stole Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nomination and held it hostage for a year, before gifting it to President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This notion, that the Mitch McConnell and co. literally “stole” the nomination, is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/24/opinion/sunday/the-stolen-supreme-court-seat.html&#34;&gt;favorite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/24/opinion/sunday/the-stolen-supreme-court-seat.html&#34;&gt;talking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/opinion/the-supreme-court-as-partisan-tool.html&#34;&gt;point&lt;/a&gt; of the NYT editorial board and similarly-minded folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways this might be true. The first is if the Senate has a duty to confirm anybody the President nominates. No one believes this. Article II of the Constitution is unambiguous that lifetime judicial appointments require the “Advice and Consent of the Senate….” And Senate Democrats’ recent treatment of Neil Gorsuch would be in serious breach of their duty to rubber-stamp any Presidential nominee, if such a duty existed. But it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a second way you could argue Republicans stole the nomination: If you believe they would not have considered &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; Obama appointee, you might say they stole the seat by denying Obama his constitutional right to attempt to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. And in fact the NYT editorial board said as much in their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/24/opinion/sunday/the-stolen-supreme-court-seat.html&#34;&gt;December 24 editorial&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The seat] was stolen by top Senate Republicans, who broke with longstanding tradition and refused to consider any nominee Mr. Obama might send them…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any&lt;/strong&gt; nominee? Here’s a thought experiment: If Obama had nominated Gorsuch instead of Garland, would the Senate have confirmed him? Of course. Supposing McConnell liked Obama’s nominee, he would have been crazy to delay confirmation hearings till after the November elections, when Hillary Clinton might have been president, Democrats might have controlled the Senate, or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When McConnell announced he wouldn’t consider an Obama nominee, behind that statement was an (ultimately correct) assumption that Obama would never nominate anybody to whom Senate Republicans would consent. If Obama believed it was vital that the Supreme Court have nine justices at all times, there are plenty of conservative judges who would have made it through the Senate. He had nearly a year to withdraw Garland’s nomination and nominate any one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama didn’t do that. As de facto leader of the Democratic Party, he decided Democrats were better off taking their chances under the next president. The delay in appointing a new justice was as much a result of Obama’s political calculations as of Mitch McConnell’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Obama and McConnell in essence agreed to punt on the appointment process, why would the NYT editorial board place the blame exclusively on McConnell and the Republicans? Is it because they are so partisan, they are willing to set aside facts when writing their editorials? And why doesn’t Editor-in-Chief Dean Baquet step in to insist that his paper’s editorials consist of something other than the most mendacious propaganda?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are clarifying questions to bear in mind when considering our paper-of-record’s output.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My, What Sharp Teeth You Have: An Underdog Story</title>
      <link>/2012/06/14/my-what-sharp-teeth-you-have-an-underdog-story/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Jun 2012 18:14:51 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2012/06/14/my-what-sharp-teeth-you-have-an-underdog-story/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;“She’s 29 year-old womaaan,” the troubadour at center stage sang out, his head thrown back and eyes shut in lamentation. “No man wants to take her as his wife, unless he wants a miserable life.” The troubador, Fakril, paused for effect—the characters around him on stage crept closer—and then resumed, with fists clenched like a 1980s power balladeer: “It’s because she’s messy and filthyyy, you will die from the smell of&amp;hellip;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Stop, stop!” I broke in, cutting off the troubadour’s song. This had to be fixed before our rehearsal went any further. “Fakril, say ‘She&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; 29 year-old woman.’ You forgot the indefinite article. But everything else was great.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat back in the director’s chair and listened as Fakril took up the tune again and delved further into the hygienic failings of our play’s title character, Little Red Riding Hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the name of the musical was familiar to me, that was the only part of this production I recognized from my own days in grade school. Maybe the Brothers Grimm forgot the part about Red Riding Hood being an insolent litterbug staring down age 30 and a lonely spinsterhood unless she cleaned up her act and found a good man pronto. Perhaps my third-grade teacher skipped over the passage about the Big Bad Wolf marrying Red Riding Hood’s widowed grandmother, so that Red would have a strong paternal figure in her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No doubt this retelling of Red Riding Hood packed a Stepfordian wallop absent from most versions of the classic tale, but once on stage, our play raised eyebrows not for its politics, but for the charm of the actors, the ingenuity of the prop work, and the way it conveyed the magic of the fairytale. In only three weeks, the students took a 25-page script and turned it into a championship caliber production—and they and I have the trophies to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going any further, some context: I teach at SMK Tengku Ibrahim, or “TipTop” to students and faculty, in Permaisuri, Terengganu. My students range from 13-year-olds barely taller than my waist to 19-year-old Form Six students only months from entering university. Their goals are as diverse as Malaysian society itself: There are many who hope to study medicine or engineering in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, or the United Kingdom, and some who tell me their career plans stop at the oil palm plantations that surround this small town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TipTop isn’t nearly the worst school in Setiu district—40 percent of the students in each form are in advanced classes—but it isn’t the best either, and all of the best schools would be at the district drama competition for which we were preparing. Historically, that hadn’t boded well us. In 2011, TipTop finished dead last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other teacher directing this year’s play, Mr. Ahmad Lokman, was determined that would not happen again. More than a month before the competition, Mr. Lokman was visiting classes to recruit students for the cast and crew, and rehearsals began in earnest three weeks out. I helped paint scenery, gave notes on the performances, and worked with the actors to improve their grammar and pronunciation, which count for a large portion of the final score in English drama competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students worked on the play five days a week, during lunch breaks and after school. They knew they were at a disadvantage against the local elite schools, whose students mostly live in dormitories and could practice together late into the night. That wasn’t an option for many of our students, so they wanted to start rehearsing early and squeeze in every possible minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And gradually, as five dry runs through the play turned into ten and then thirty, our Little Red Riding Hood was transformed from a series of missed cues and forgotten lines into an impressively polished production. There were moments, like when Red and her grandmother have a wordless cooking/dancing/drawing/boxing competition to determine who is the more suitable bride—just trust me on this—that would have been at home on a much larger stage, in front of a paying audience. Overall, the play was very good, the students’ effort evident in every scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, on competition day in mid-April, as we made our way to SMA Setiu, a religious school that was the site of this year’s drama showcase, there was no shaking the memories of years past, when TipTop’s drama teams were shown up by the better prepared elite schools. Our actors, generally an outgoing bunch, were unusually quiet that morning, and since we were slated to perform last, our nervousness—I was feeling nervous on the actors’ behalf—would be drawn out as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least it would be for the students, who had been sequestered behind the auditorium by Mr. Lokman, instructed to practice their lines and pay no mind to the other schools’ shows. But I was inside, watching everything from the front row, and with each school that dropped the curtains and took a bow, I grew more convinced that this was TipTop’s year. Even though the other plays were well done, I could tell that if our students performed as they had in rehearsal, TipTop would be the champions of Setiu district. When our turn came and my students began taking the stage, I reminded them to speak loudly, and wished them luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They didn’t need it. After weeks of work, all the blocking, scene changes, and singing came together seamlessly on stage. Fakril called Red Riding Hood “a 29-year-old woman,” Red’s worried mother implored God to make “her change,” not “she change,” and the fairy-dust-glitter that blessed the union of Grandmother and Big Bad Wolf twinkled down from the rafters at exactly the right moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed almost flawless, and for all the nerves I felt before the performance, there were none when the judges adjourned to tally the scores. We’d won easily, and it felt like only a formality when the emcee called out “TipTop Juara!” and the students rushed back on stage to collect their championship trophies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me, I was of course immensely proud of my students, and though I’ll always prefer a more traditional rendition of Red Riding Hood, any misgivings I had about our play’s message were put to rest while talking to the students outside the auditorium, after they got their trophies. Working on the script a month prior, I’d been tempted to tone down the scorn heaped on Red Riding Hood, maybe throw in a line about marriage not being the absolute fulfillment of a woman’s potential on earth, but I realized how completely I missed the point when one of the fairies approached me, trophy in hand, and started telling me how worried she was before the day’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think we would lost and an elite school would win,” she said. “Now I see TipTop can win Setiu district, and I think we can win Terengganu also.” I told her I agreed, and it struck me that this girl, dressed in all pink everything with fairy wings and a halo, had just spelled out the real moral of our story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;——&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sizzling you hear is the cockles of my heart, man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote this for the official MACEE/Fulbright Malaysia blog. Head &lt;a href=&#34;http://fulbrightmalaysiaeta.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;over there&lt;/a&gt; to read more tales of meaningful cultural exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
