      <title>Did Trump Beat Hillary By AN Historic Margin?</title>
      <link>/2017/04/13/did-trump-beat-hillary-by-an-historic-margin/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another&lt;/strong&gt; timely dispatch from your man in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of November’s election, Trump took heavy fire from the press for claiming his Electoral College victory over Clinton was the largest “since Reagan.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article from Vox, headlined &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/16/14639058/trump-electoral-college-win&#34;&gt;Trump keeps lying about his Electoral College victory&lt;/a&gt;, is typical of the pushback. It compares, unfavorably, Trump’s Electoral College total to those of his recent predecessors. Trump received 304 (306, minus two faithless electors) out of 538 electoral votes, which is less than:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama’s 332 in 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama’s 365 in 2008&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Clinton’s 379 in 1996&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Clinton’s 370 in 1992&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;and George H. W. Bush’s 426 in 1988&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While those numbers are clear, they are also a poor metric for the magnitude of Trump’s win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say that because in any election year, only a minority of all electoral votes are up for grabs. The majority will go to one candidate or the other purely because of their party affiliation. No political fortune or failure will change that. That Trump won Tennessee’s 11 votes had nothing to do with his merits as a candidate, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, and because most states apportion their votes in winner-take-all fashion, a presidential election can be reduced the outcomes of a relative handful of states: the “swing states” where both candidates spend the bulk of their time and money. To see how well the candidates fared, you have to focus on these states and discount the states where the result was a foregone conclusion. That allows you to evaluate the outcome independent of the fact that both Democrats and Republicans currently have 160+ guaranteed electoral votes baked into the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of argument I’ll say that a swing state is one where in the final vote, the major parties finished within 10 percentage points of each other. Or put another way, one where the loser needed five points or fewer to flip the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering only those states, here are the presidential election results &amp;ldquo;since Reagan&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Year&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;Rep. Votes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;Dem. Votes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;Winner&amp;rsquo;s Margin&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1988&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;168&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;96&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;+26%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1992&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;133&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;127&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;-2%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1996&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;124&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;127&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;+1%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;125&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;+12%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2004&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;103&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;160&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;-22%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2008&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;53&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;106&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;+33%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2012&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;42&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;141&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;+54%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2016&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;178&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;+66%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this metric Trump’s win &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; the biggest since Reagan! I believe this also explains why it seemed big: Trump got an outsized share of the swing states, which dominate the discussion of electoral results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this approach underrate strong winners (who are more likely to win by &amp;gt;10%) and overrate weak winners (who have more close calls)? Maybe, but I expect that effect to be net-neutral, as strong winners should also flip more close states into their column and away from their opponents. It also might &lt;strong&gt;over&lt;/strong&gt;rate weak losers, like Bob Dole in 1996, whose total above includes 32 electoral votes from Texas, which he only won by 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other anomaly to note is that John Kerry in 2004 won California by 9.95%, so it counts toward his total. Less California&amp;rsquo;s 55 votes, the numbers for 2004 are 103–105 against Bush, reflecting the close overall result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a more telling and certainly more interesting way to compare presidential elections across time than raw electoral vote totals. Also it was tedious as hell and I understand why those churning out grist for content mills like Vox wouldn&amp;rsquo;t bother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this said, I still rate the original claim, that Trump won by an historic margin, four pants-on-fire out of five (🔥👖🔥👖🔥👖🔥👖 / 5) because saying “an historic” is obviously wrong, “a” is the proper article there and nobody worth listening to thinks otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>10 Thoughts On &#39;North Carolina Is No Longer A Democracy&#39;</title>
      <link>/2017/04/02/10-thoughts-on-north-carolina-is-no-longer-a-democracy/</link>

      <guid>/2017/04/02/10-thoughts-on-north-carolina-is-no-longer-a-democracy/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Three months after it was published, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/op-ed/article122593759.html&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by UNC  professor Andrew Reynolds is still getting re-tweeted into my timeline. It is a bad article and I’m disappointed to see such shoddy work coming from a North Carolinian (albeit a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Reynolds_(political_scientist)&#34;&gt;non-native&lt;/a&gt;) employed by North Carolina’s flagship university. In the interest of making amends for my fair state, here are 10 thoughts on why the article should be retracted and replaced by a sincere apology:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;democracy-is-not-quantifiable&#34;&gt;Democracy is not quantifiable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article is based on a report from the “””Electoral Integrity Project””” (EIP) which scores each state’s democracy on a 1-100 scale. (Reynolds sits on the EIP board). This is a quixotic exercise given that the nature of a democracy has been debated for millenniums, with no consensus yet reached. That Reynolds and the other professors behind this report are blithely scoring democracies on a 100-point scale, with no mention made of the vagaries involved in specifying just what a democracy is, raises a red flag to put it mildly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-s-just-a-survey&#34;&gt;It’s just a survey&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reynolds’ op-ed gives the impression that he and his collaborators created a rubric for democratic processes, then carefully weighed North Carolina’s system and found it wanting. They did not! Actually, the EIP sends out surveys to political science professors across the country. The surveys have questions about things like voting laws and press freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing wrong with surveys, but one survey such as this does not provide the basis for declaring North Carolina a failed democracy. And where does the delineation between “democratic” and “undemocratic” come from? It is a figment of Reynolds’ imagination. The survey did not ask respondents if their states were democracies. Had I participated, I would resent Reynolds going to the press with such an extreme conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;and-it-s-a-bad-survey&#34;&gt;And it’s a bad survey&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey asks respondents to agree or disagree with statements like “Votes were counted fairly” and “Some ineligible electors were registered.” Are poli sci professors privy to some special insights that allow them to assess these things more knowledgeably than anyone else? Did they oversee the vote counting? Audit the voter rolls? No. Nevertheless, their responses to these questions are counted for/against a state’s “””index of electoral integrity”””.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;north-carolina-ranked-okay&#34;&gt;North Carolina ranked okay&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When EIP used the survey results to rank the states by electoral integrity, NC came in 37th: ahead of 11 states, tied with two, and within a few points of 10 more. This goes unmentioned in Reynolds’ article. If North Carolina is not a democracy, then neither are broad swaths of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-rankings-are-absurd-anyway&#34;&gt;The rankings are absurd anyway&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you accept that ranking states by how democratic they are is a reasonable thing to do, this is a bad ranking. Top-ranked Vermont had four professors respond to the survey. Second-place Idaho had five responses, third-place New Hampshire had five, and last place Arizona had six. Alaska, Delaware, New Mexico, Utah, West Virginia, and both Dakotas had three or fewer responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers are not included in Reynolds’ article, nor anywhere on EIP’s website, but instead buried in the raw data, presumably because they are woefully insufficient to support the conclusions Reynolds et al. draw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;north-carolina-did-well-on-the-most-important-question&#34;&gt;North Carolina did well on the most important question&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EIP doesn’t ask respondents if their state is a democracy, but it DOES ask them to rate their state’s electoral integrity on a 1–10 scale, and to do the same for the US generally. On average, NC received a 7.25 / 10. That looks substantially higher than the 58 / 100 electoral integrity index that the EIP calculated for NC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also of interest: 17 of North Carolina’s 29 respondents rated the state’s electoral integrity on par with or higher than the integrity of US elections generally. Granted I am not a political science professor but that seems like a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;north-carolina-scored-pretty-well-on-the-eip-s-own-scale&#34;&gt;North Carolina scored pretty well on the EIP’s own scale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to EIP, states that score 50-60 on their hundred point scale have “moderate” electoral integrity. Those that score above 60 have “high” integrity. North Carolina scored a 58.2, which is on the border of moderate and high, and in fact the upper bound of the confidence interval was a 61.8, which would put the state in the high integrity band. This again was not mentioned in Reynolds’ op-ed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;expertise-isn-t-everything&#34;&gt;Expertise isn’t everything&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the issues with the EIP survey and how its results were presented, I want to discuss the topic of expertise generally. Expertise can only get you so far. To cite a recent example, the combined expertise of everyone on Hillary Clinton’s campaign payroll couldn’t beat the buffoon Donald Trump. And of course, none of the experts at the NYTimes, 538, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://election.princeton.edu/&#34;&gt;Princeton Election Consortium&lt;/a&gt; predicted that outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that there are things which are, at least for now, beyond the reach of expertise. Measuring precisely how democratic, or not, a state may be, is one such thing. And people like UNC professor Andrew Reynolds, who claim to be experts, should apply their expertise with humility and in measured ways. Declaring you have empirically determined that North Carolina is “no longer… a functioning democracy” is the opposite of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-moral-dimension-of-this-article&#34;&gt;The moral dimension of this article&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did UNC professor Andrew Reynolds fail to uphold his moral obligation as an educator and semi-public figure? I don’t want to lob insults. I don’t know Reynolds and he may be a fine person. But in this instance, Reynolds acted deceptively by withholding such facts as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;his findings were based on a survey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;on that survey, North Carolina outscored a number of other US states&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;when asked to rate North Carolina’s electoral integrity on a 1–10 scale, a significant majority of respondents rated it highly (7 / 10 or better)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, when an interviewer from GQ gently &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gq.com/story/north-carolina-andrew-reynolds-political-science-interview&#34;&gt;pressed Reynolds on the EIP’s methodology&lt;/a&gt;, Reynolds wouldn’t defend the survey and even distanced himself from it, saying “the EIP—which I’m not involved in running, I was just involved in its founding—the EIP is not perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that’s how he feels, why was he citing the EIP as gospel in his original article? Why didn’t the first article mention the EIP’s flaws? Reynolds concealing his misgivings about the EIP while using it to condemn North Carolina’s democracy is, to me, also deceptive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;poor-scholarship-in-slick-packaging&#34;&gt;Poor scholarship in slick packaging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s really offensive about the EIP is that its misinformation is targeted at non-experts. It distills its results into a simplistic ranking—effectively a prefab listicle—which is obviously going to garner press attention. The ranking strips the raw data of its complexity, making it easily digestible for all and sundry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No political science professor would care that North Carolina scored a 58 on the “electoral integrity index.” The only people who will care are casual readers, who will see this study and not recognize it for the transparent nonsense it is. Those people will read the EIP report, or Reynolds’ article, and leave thinking that North Carolina actually isn’t a democracy, as if there is a global registry of democracies that gets updated each election cycle. That is a conclusion that is somewhere between “highly suspect” and “demonstrably false,” and yet UNC professor Andrew Reynolds is peddling it to the general public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to belabor the point but deliberately misleading the public is the opposite of what UNC professors are hired to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bonus-thought-what-s-to-be-done&#34;&gt;Bonus thought: What’s to be done?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me conclude by saying I do not think Reynolds should be fired for this. He probably couldn’t be anyway, tenure being what it is. My opinion is that a public reprimand by UNC and an apology from Reynolds would fit the crime &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; discourage others in his position from pulling such deceptive, attention-grubbing stunts in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the interest of fairness, I will email Reynolds to see if he cares to respond in this space.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Democracy Looks Like</title>
      <link>/2017/01/31/what-democracy-looks-like/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2017 20:19:47 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2017/01/31/what-democracy-looks-like/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As first reported in my last post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/immigration/january_2017/most_support_temporary_ban_on_newcomers_from_terrorist_havens&#34;&gt;Rasmussen Reports&lt;/a&gt; national telephone and online survey finds that 57% of Likely U.S. Voters favor a temporary ban on refugees from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;57% for the refugee ban, 33% opposed. As for temporarily blocking all citizens of the listed countries from entering the country, 56% are in favor, 32% against. Not even close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise of republican democracy is that at some point, policy yields to the will of the people. Delay that point far enough, and you get a correction like the one Trump is now presiding over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my final thought on the matter is this. If you were asked to devise a policy position that encapsulates the callous arrogance and obliviousness of American liberalism circa January 2017, you couldn’t do any better than angrily insisting that Yemenis and Somalis and Libyans &lt;em&gt;must be&lt;/em&gt; resettled in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Thrill Of The Fight</title>
      <link>/2017/01/28/the-thrill-of-the-fight/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2017 20:22:18 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2017/01/28/the-thrill-of-the-fight/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why are liberals fighting Trump on refugees? Accepting refugees from countries like Syria, Iraq, and Yemen is not popular.* There are better ways to help people in those countries. A sane left, whose goal was not opposing President Trump but rather advancing its values, would not waste time trying to convince America that importing Syrians serves the national interest. It&amp;rsquo;s a losing issue. The fight highlights that Trump is in fact giving most of America what it wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the point is not to advance liberal values. It is to stoke outrage and obstruct the President at every turn. (When the right took a similar tack during the previous administration, it was less disruptive because conservatives are less prone to marching in the streets and don’t control the mainstream media.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why the issue is presented as an absurd choice between resettling refugees in the United States, and ignoring them. Sensible alternatives, such as increased support for refugee camps in areas affected by the refugee ban, are not mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never mind that such a plan would benefit more refugees than resettlement ever could. Never mind that it would be great PR for America. Never mind that, unlike resettlement, it would draw bipartisan support in Congress and from the electorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Championing a compromise like that would require ceding an inch to President Trump, so the left won’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Here’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2416&#34;&gt;one poll&lt;/a&gt; that shows as much. Google it and there’s a bunch more.&lt;/p&gt;
