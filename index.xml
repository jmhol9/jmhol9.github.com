      <title>Did Trump Beat Hillary By AN Historic Margin?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another&lt;/strong&gt; timely dispatch from your man in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of November’s election, Trump took heavy fire from the press for claiming his Electoral College victory over Clinton was the largest “since Reagan.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article from Vox, headlined &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/16/14639058/trump-electoral-college-win&#34;&gt;Trump keeps lying about his Electoral College victory&lt;/a&gt;, is typical of the pushback. It compares, unfavorably, Trump’s Electoral College total to those of his recent predecessors. Trump received 304 (306, minus two faithless electors) out of 538 electoral votes, which is less than:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama’s 332 in 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama’s 365 in 2008&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Clinton’s 379 in 1996&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Clinton’s 370 in 1992&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;and George H. W. Bush’s 426 in 1988&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While those numbers are clear, they are also a poor metric for the magnitude of Trump’s win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say that because in any election year, only a minority of all electoral votes are up for grabs. The majority will go to one candidate or the other purely because of their party affiliation. No political fortune or failure will change that. That Trump won Tennessee’s 11 votes had nothing to do with his merits as a candidate, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, and because most states apportion their votes in winner-take-all fashion, a presidential election can be reduced the outcomes of a relative handful of states: the “swing states” where both candidates spend the bulk of their time and money. To see how well the candidates fared, you have to focus on these states and discount the states where the result was a foregone conclusion. That allows you to evaluate the outcome independent of the fact that both Democrats and Republicans currently have 160+ guaranteed electoral votes baked into the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of argument I’ll say that a swing state is one where in the final vote, the major parties finished within 10 percentage points of each other. Or put another way, one where the loser needed five points or fewer to flip the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering only those states, here are the presidential election results &amp;ldquo;since Reagan&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Year&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;Rep. Votes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;Dem. Votes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;Winner&amp;rsquo;s Margin&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1988&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;168&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;96&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;+26%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1992&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;133&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;127&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;-2%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1996&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;124&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;127&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;+1%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;125&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;+12%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2004&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;103&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;160&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;-22%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2008&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;53&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;106&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;+33%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2012&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;42&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;141&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;+54%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2016&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;178&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;+66%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this metric Trump’s win &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; the biggest since Reagan! I believe this also explains why it seemed big: Trump got an outsized share of the swing states, which dominate the discussion of electoral results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this approach underrate strong winners (who are more likely to win by &amp;gt;10%) and overrate weak winners (who have more close calls)? Maybe, but I expect that effect to be net-neutral, as strong winners should also flip more close states into their column and away from their opponents. It also might &lt;strong&gt;over&lt;/strong&gt;rate weak losers, like Bob Dole in 1996, whose total above includes 32 electoral votes from Texas, which he only won by 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other anomaly to note is that John Kerry in 2004 won California by 9.95%, so it counts toward his total. Less California&amp;rsquo;s 55 votes, the numbers for 2004 are 103–105 against Bush, reflecting the close overall result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a more telling and certainly more interesting way to compare presidential elections across time than raw electoral vote totals. Also it was tedious as hell and I understand why those churning out grist for content mills like Vox wouldn&amp;rsquo;t bother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this said, I still rate the original claim, that Trump won by an historic margin, four pants-on-fire out of five (🔥👖🔥👖🔥👖🔥👖 / 5) because saying “an historic” is obviously wrong, “a” is the proper article there and nobody worth listening to thinks otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Did Senate Republicans Steal Obama&#39;s Nomination?</title>
      <link>/2017/04/11/did-senate-republicans-steal-obamas-nomination/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2017 08:51:26 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2017/04/11/did-senate-republicans-steal-obamas-nomination/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Keeping with my preference to stay a step behind the news cycle, I’d like to discuss the claim that Senate Republicans stole Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nomination and held it hostage for a year, before gifting it to President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This notion, that the Mitch McConnell and co. literally “stole” the nomination, is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/24/opinion/sunday/the-stolen-supreme-court-seat.html&#34;&gt;favorite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/24/opinion/sunday/the-stolen-supreme-court-seat.html&#34;&gt;talking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/opinion/the-supreme-court-as-partisan-tool.html&#34;&gt;point&lt;/a&gt; of the NYT editorial board and similarly-minded folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways this might be true. The first is if the Senate has a duty to confirm anybody the President nominates. No one believes this. Article II of the Constitution is unambiguous that lifetime judicial appointments require the “Advice and Consent of the Senate….” And Senate Democrats’ recent treatment of Neil Gorsuch would be in serious breach of their duty to rubber-stamp any Presidential nominee, if such a duty existed. But it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a second way you could argue Republicans stole the nomination: If you believe they would not have considered &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; Obama appointee, you might say they stole the seat by denying Obama his constitutional right to attempt to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. And in fact the NYT editorial board said as much in their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/24/opinion/sunday/the-stolen-supreme-court-seat.html&#34;&gt;December 24 editorial&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The seat] was stolen by top Senate Republicans, who broke with longstanding tradition and refused to consider any nominee Mr. Obama might send them…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any&lt;/strong&gt; nominee? Here’s a thought experiment: If Obama had nominated Gorsuch instead of Garland, would the Senate have confirmed him? Of course. Supposing McConnell liked Obama’s nominee, he would have been crazy to delay confirmation hearings till after the November elections, when Hillary Clinton might have been president, Democrats might have controlled the Senate, or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When McConnell announced he wouldn’t consider an Obama nominee, behind that statement was an (ultimately correct) assumption that Obama would never nominate anybody to whom Senate Republicans would consent. If Obama believed it was vital that the Supreme Court have nine justices at all times, there are plenty of conservative judges who would have made it through the Senate. He had nearly a year to withdraw Garland’s nomination and nominate any one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama didn’t do that. As de facto leader of the Democratic Party, he decided Democrats were better off taking their chances under the next president. The delay in appointing a new justice was as much a result of Obama’s political calculations as of Mitch McConnell’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Obama and McConnell in essence agreed to punt on the appointment process, why would the NYT editorial board place the blame exclusively on McConnell and the Republicans? Is it because they are so partisan, they are willing to set aside facts when writing their editorials? And why doesn’t Editor-in-Chief Dean Baquet step in to insist that his paper’s editorials consist of something other than the most mendacious propaganda?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are clarifying questions to bear in mind when considering our paper-of-record’s output.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>10 Thoughts On &#39;North Carolina Is No Longer A Democracy&#39;</title>
      <link>/2017/04/02/10-thoughts-on-north-carolina-is-no-longer-a-democracy/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Three months after it was published, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/op-ed/article122593759.html&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by UNC  professor Andrew Reynolds is still getting re-tweeted into my timeline. It is a bad article and I’m disappointed to see such shoddy work coming from a North Carolinian (albeit a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Reynolds_(political_scientist)&#34;&gt;non-native&lt;/a&gt;) employed by North Carolina’s flagship university. In the interest of making amends for my fair state, here are 10 thoughts on why the article should be retracted and replaced by a sincere apology:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;democracy-is-not-quantifiable&#34;&gt;Democracy is not quantifiable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article is based on a report from the “””Electoral Integrity Project””” (EIP) which scores each state’s democracy on a 1-100 scale. (Reynolds sits on the EIP board). This is a quixotic exercise given that the nature of a democracy has been debated for millenniums, with no consensus yet reached. That Reynolds and the other professors behind this report are blithely scoring democracies on a 100-point scale, with no mention made of the vagaries involved in specifying just what a democracy is, raises a red flag to put it mildly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-s-just-a-survey&#34;&gt;It’s just a survey&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reynolds’ op-ed gives the impression that he and his collaborators created a rubric for democratic processes, then carefully weighed North Carolina’s system and found it wanting. They did not! Actually, the EIP sends out surveys to political science professors across the country. The surveys have questions about things like voting laws and press freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing wrong with surveys, but one survey such as this does not provide the basis for declaring North Carolina a failed democracy. And where does the delineation between “democratic” and “undemocratic” come from? It is a figment of Reynolds’ imagination. The survey did not ask respondents if their states were democracies. Had I participated, I would resent Reynolds going to the press with such an extreme conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;and-it-s-a-bad-survey&#34;&gt;And it’s a bad survey&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey asks respondents to agree or disagree with statements like “Votes were counted fairly” and “Some ineligible electors were registered.” Are poli sci professors privy to some special insights that allow them to assess these things more knowledgeably than anyone else? Did they oversee the vote counting? Audit the voter rolls? No. Nevertheless, their responses to these questions are counted for/against a state’s “””index of electoral integrity”””.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;north-carolina-ranked-okay&#34;&gt;North Carolina ranked okay&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When EIP used the survey results to rank the states by electoral integrity, NC came in 37th: ahead of 11 states, tied with two, and within a few points of 10 more. This goes unmentioned in Reynolds’ article. If North Carolina is not a democracy, then neither are broad swaths of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-rankings-are-absurd-anyway&#34;&gt;The rankings are absurd anyway&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you accept that ranking states by how democratic they are is a reasonable thing to do, this is a bad ranking. Top-ranked Vermont had four professors respond to the survey. Second-place Idaho had five responses, third-place New Hampshire had five, and last place Arizona had six. Alaska, Delaware, New Mexico, Utah, West Virginia, and both Dakotas had three or fewer responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers are not included in Reynolds’ article, nor anywhere on EIP’s website, but instead buried in the raw data, presumably because they are woefully insufficient to support the conclusions Reynolds et al. draw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;north-carolina-did-well-on-the-most-important-question&#34;&gt;North Carolina did well on the most important question&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EIP doesn’t ask respondents if their state is a democracy, but it DOES ask them to rate their state’s electoral integrity on a 1–10 scale, and to do the same for the US generally. On average, NC received a 7.25 / 10. That looks substantially higher than the 58 / 100 electoral integrity index that the EIP calculated for NC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also of interest: 17 of North Carolina’s 29 respondents rated the state’s electoral integrity on par with or higher than the integrity of US elections generally. Granted I am not a political science professor but that seems like a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;north-carolina-scored-pretty-well-on-the-eip-s-own-scale&#34;&gt;North Carolina scored pretty well on the EIP’s own scale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to EIP, states that score 50-60 on their hundred point scale have “moderate” electoral integrity. Those that score above 60 have “high” integrity. North Carolina scored a 58.2, which is on the border of moderate and high, and in fact the upper bound of the confidence interval was a 61.8, which would put the state in the high integrity band. This again was not mentioned in Reynolds’ op-ed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;expertise-isn-t-everything&#34;&gt;Expertise isn’t everything&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the issues with the EIP survey and how its results were presented, I want to discuss the topic of expertise generally. Expertise can only get you so far. To cite a recent example, the combined expertise of everyone on Hillary Clinton’s campaign payroll couldn’t beat the buffoon Donald Trump. And of course, none of the experts at the NYTimes, 538, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://election.princeton.edu/&#34;&gt;Princeton Election Consortium&lt;/a&gt; predicted that outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that there are things which are, at least for now, beyond the reach of expertise. Measuring precisely how democratic, or not, a state may be, is one such thing. And people like UNC professor Andrew Reynolds, who claim to be experts, should apply their expertise with humility and in measured ways. Declaring you have empirically determined that North Carolina is “no longer… a functioning democracy” is the opposite of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-moral-dimension-of-this-article&#34;&gt;The moral dimension of this article&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did UNC professor Andrew Reynolds fail to uphold his moral obligation as an educator and semi-public figure? I don’t want to lob insults. I don’t know Reynolds and he may be a fine person. But in this instance, Reynolds acted deceptively by withholding such facts as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;his findings were based on a survey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;on that survey, North Carolina outscored a number of other US states&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;when asked to rate North Carolina’s electoral integrity on a 1–10 scale, a significant majority of respondents rated it highly (7 / 10 or better)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, when an interviewer from GQ gently &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gq.com/story/north-carolina-andrew-reynolds-political-science-interview&#34;&gt;pressed Reynolds on the EIP’s methodology&lt;/a&gt;, Reynolds wouldn’t defend the survey and even distanced himself from it, saying “the EIP—which I’m not involved in running, I was just involved in its founding—the EIP is not perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that’s how he feels, why was he citing the EIP as gospel in his original article? Why didn’t the first article mention the EIP’s flaws? Reynolds concealing his misgivings about the EIP while using it to condemn North Carolina’s democracy is, to me, also deceptive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;poor-scholarship-in-slick-packaging&#34;&gt;Poor scholarship in slick packaging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s really offensive part is that the EIP (which Reynolds may not run but certainly helped publicize) distills its results into a simplistic ranking—effectively a prefab listicle—which is obviously going to garner press attention. The ranking strips the raw data of its complexity, making it easily digestible for all and sundry. When I first saw Reynolds&amp;rsquo; article, I suspected it was bullshit from the word go and confirmed that by looking at the data. Realistically, most people won’t bother to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people will read the EIP report, or Reynolds’ article, and leave thinking that North Carolina actually isn’t a democracy, as if there is a global registry of democracies that gets updated each election cycle. That is a conclusion that is somewhere between “highly suspect” and “demonstrably false,” and yet UNC professor Andrew Reynolds is peddling it to the general public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to belabor the point but deliberately misleading the public is the opposite of what UNC professors are hired to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bonus-thought-what-s-to-be-done&#34;&gt;Bonus thought: What’s to be done?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me conclude by saying I do not think Reynolds should be fired for this. He probably couldn’t be anyway, tenure being what it is. My opinion is that a public reprimand by UNC and an apology from Reynolds would fit the crime &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; discourage others in his position from pulling such deceptive, attention-grubbing stunts in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the interest of fairness, I will email Reynolds to see if he cares to respond in this space.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Democracy Looks Like</title>
      <link>/2017/01/31/what-democracy-looks-like/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2017 20:19:47 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2017/01/31/what-democracy-looks-like/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As first reported in my last post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/immigration/january_2017/most_support_temporary_ban_on_newcomers_from_terrorist_havens&#34;&gt;Rasmussen Reports&lt;/a&gt; national telephone and online survey finds that 57% of Likely U.S. Voters favor a temporary ban on refugees from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;57% for the refugee ban, 33% opposed. As for temporarily blocking all citizens of the listed countries from entering the country, 56% are in favor, 32% against. Not even close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise of republican democracy is that at some point, policy yields to the will of the people. Delay that point far enough, and you get a correction like the one Trump is now presiding over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my final thought on the matter is this. If you were asked to devise a policy position that encapsulates the callous arrogance and obliviousness of American liberalism circa January 2017, you couldn’t do any better than angrily insisting that Yemenis and Somalis and Libyans &lt;em&gt;must be&lt;/em&gt; resettled in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Thrill Of The Fight</title>
      <link>/2017/01/28/the-thrill-of-the-fight/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2017 20:22:18 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2017/01/28/the-thrill-of-the-fight/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why are liberals fighting Trump on refugees? Accepting refugees from countries like Syria, Iraq, and Yemen is not popular.* There are better ways to help people in those countries. A sane left, whose goal was not opposing President Trump but rather advancing its values, would not waste time trying to convince America that importing Syrians serves the national interest. It&amp;rsquo;s a losing issue. The fight highlights that Trump is in fact giving most of America what it wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the point is not to advance liberal values. It is to stoke outrage and obstruct the President at every turn. (When the right took a similar tack during the previous administration, it was less disruptive because conservatives are less prone to marching in the streets and don’t control the mainstream media.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why the issue is presented as an absurd choice between resettling refugees in the United States, and ignoring them. Sensible alternatives, such as increased support for refugee camps in areas affected by the refugee ban, are not mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never mind that such a plan would benefit more refugees than resettlement ever could. Never mind that it would be great PR for America. Never mind that, unlike resettlement, it would draw bipartisan support in Congress and from the electorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Championing a compromise like that would require ceding an inch to President Trump, so the left won’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Here’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2416&#34;&gt;one poll&lt;/a&gt; that shows as much. Google it and there’s a bunch more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Captain’s Hard Time Dining does not cater to those with hang-ups about food sanitation. The paper napkin is likely to be the one piece of your place setting not encrusted with food from previous diners, but if you’re willing to call such oversights “charming” rather than “health code violations,” there’s something special in store. While the offerings are mostly standard—eggs and sausage for breakfast, sandwiches for lunch, basic cuts of chicken and beef for dinner—Captain’s nonetheless operates at the outermost edge of the greasy spoon category, pressing the limits of what’s acceptable to fry, butter, or bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sides of supposedly “fresh” broccoli and other greens invariably arrive sopping with butter and oil, so instead of beating around the bush, just order the “fried and battered vegetables.” Breads, whether biscuits, pancakes, or rolls, come so thoroughly pre-buttered you’ll want to wring them out. Fried meats aren’t simply fried: They’re “butter fried.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Captain’s estimation, no dish is so refined that it wouldn’t benefit from a slice of bacon, a side of ranch, or a few onion rings—and mostly, he’s right. True, eat here regularly and you’ll follow up the freshman 15 with the sophomore coronary, but as an occasional treat, there’s no topping the delicious excess of Captain’s Hard Time Dining.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lost Cat</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuing with the story from last time&lt;/strong&gt;: I think afterward that cat ate the pineapple. Something sure did. Monitor lizards are also likely culprits. Those fellas will eat anything, including perhaps the cat, who&amp;rsquo;s been real scarce since we came home from Vietnam. But I know better than to get my hopes up on that count. The cat&amp;rsquo;s disappeared in the past for days at a stretch only to turn up on our porch, on otherwise unspoiled mornings, stinking of catnip and meowing for handouts and, often as not, knocked up with kittens I&amp;rsquo;ll have to support out of my own pocket. And then Neek—who&amp;rsquo;s partial to the ho mom-cat and got us into this predicament months ago by giving her some chicken chop in spite of my warning that he not feed the cats or show human warmth to the children, they&amp;rsquo;ll never leave—Neek asks how come I&amp;rsquo;m looking after those kittens one moment and praying for the mom-cat to be eaten by monitor lizards or carried off by macaques (known to happen) the next. Well, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you, Neek: it takes a heart harder than mine to deny a dewy-eyed kitten your leftover wax-paper package of nasi dagang, or a few kuih Raya when we have so many. No sir, not one single &lt;em&gt;got&lt;/em&gt;damn kitten is going hungry on my watch, Neek, unless I have tickets to the Philippines. There is reason to believe the last batch of kittens starved while I was in the Philippines. Dust into dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In other news&lt;/strong&gt;: America, I&amp;rsquo;m heartbroke. Ain, the younger sister of Intan, the lady who runs my school canteen, is going back to college tomorrow. Before she thought she had two more weeks after the Hari Raya break, but no, she&amp;rsquo;s gone tomorrow and I&amp;rsquo;ll never see her again. Ain was one of the only good things about my first few days of school. There&amp;rsquo;s a certain subset of Malay girls who dress way hipster—whether that&amp;rsquo;s intentional or out of actual poverty is impossible to say—and Ain is one, which needless to say I appreciate. On top of that (as if she needed anything more!) she speaks English well and fixes me weird drinks like ice water without much fuss. We originally met while she was working the cash register and I was paying for my morning chicken rice. The first questions Ain asked me were the typical ones, if I had a girlfriend and if I wanted her to be my girlfriend, and I politely declined, but in another life, where I&amp;rsquo;m a practicing Muslim interested in relocating to freaking rural Malaysia&amp;hellip; but why speculate? I bought her a pack of kuih potong to remember me by. Should&amp;rsquo;ve chosen something non-perishable. Fuck.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fasting Month</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My mentor and I broke fast last night at Sup Belut Kak Nah, a restaurant about ten miles south of me that&amp;rsquo;s kind of an institution. Its name means &amp;ldquo;Big Sister Nah&amp;rsquo;s Eel Soup,&amp;rdquo; which gives you some idea what sort of place becomes an institution around these parts. We both passed on the eel soup and got variations on fried rice instead. I finished my entire plate in about the time it took my mentor, Zira, to eat three spoonfuls, and then she asked if I was ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now keep in mind that, prior to the evening call to prayer, we hadn&amp;rsquo;t eaten in fourteen and a half hours. I was so hungry I would have eaten eel soup, if it came to that. Zira, meanwhile, barely touched her plate. It looked like she just shuffled around a few piles of rice, then decided she was done. Americans have to eat as much before it even dawns on us we&amp;rsquo;re sticking food into our mouths. I asked how she could possibly be finished eating and she told me, by way of explanation, that she normally weighs 38 kilograms but, for Ramadan, has dropped down to 36. That&amp;rsquo;s 79.4 pounds, which— I didn&amp;rsquo;t know they made humans in that size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the car, Zira said she couldn&amp;rsquo;t bear to wear a seatbelt, she was so full. Strange complaint from a lady who never bothers with her seatbelt anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My, What Sharp Teeth You Have: An Underdog Story</title>
      <link>/2012/06/14/my-what-sharp-teeth-you-have-an-underdog-story/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“She’s 29 year-old womaaan,” the troubadour at center stage sang out, his head thrown back and eyes shut in lamentation. “No man wants to take her as his wife, unless he wants a miserable life.” The troubador, Fakril, paused for effect—the characters around him on stage crept closer—and then resumed, with fists clenched like a 1980s power balladeer: “It’s because she’s messy and filthyyy, you will die from the smell of&amp;hellip;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Stop, stop!” I broke in, cutting off the troubadour’s song. This had to be fixed before our rehearsal went any further. “Fakril, say ‘She&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; 29 year-old woman.’ You forgot the indefinite article. But everything else was great.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat back in the director’s chair and listened as Fakril took up the tune again and delved further into the hygienic failings of our play’s title character, Little Red Riding Hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the name of the musical was familiar to me, that was the only part of this production I recognized from my own days in grade school. Maybe the Brothers Grimm forgot the part about Red Riding Hood being an insolent litterbug staring down age 30 and a lonely spinsterhood unless she cleaned up her act and found a good man pronto. Perhaps my third-grade teacher skipped over the passage about the Big Bad Wolf marrying Red Riding Hood’s widowed grandmother, so that Red would have a strong paternal figure in her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No doubt this retelling of Red Riding Hood packed a Stepfordian wallop absent from most versions of the classic tale, but once on stage, our play raised eyebrows not for its politics, but for the charm of the actors, the ingenuity of the prop work, and the way it conveyed the magic of the fairytale. In only three weeks, the students took a 25-page script and turned it into a championship caliber production—and they and I have the trophies to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going any further, some context: I teach at SMK Tengku Ibrahim, or “TipTop” to students and faculty, in Permaisuri, Terengganu. My students range from 13-year-olds barely taller than my waist to 19-year-old Form Six students only months from entering university. Their goals are as diverse as Malaysian society itself: There are many who hope to study medicine or engineering in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, or the United Kingdom, and some who tell me their career plans stop at the oil palm plantations that surround this small town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TipTop isn’t nearly the worst school in Setiu district—40 percent of the students in each form are in advanced classes—but it isn’t the best either, and all of the best schools would be at the district drama competition for which we were preparing. Historically, that hadn’t boded well us. In 2011, TipTop finished dead last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other teacher directing this year’s play, Mr. Ahmad Lokman, was determined that would not happen again. More than a month before the competition, Mr. Lokman was visiting classes to recruit students for the cast and crew, and rehearsals began in earnest three weeks out. I helped paint scenery, gave notes on the performances, and worked with the actors to improve their grammar and pronunciation, which count for a large portion of the final score in English drama competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students worked on the play five days a week, during lunch breaks and after school. They knew they were at a disadvantage against the local elite schools, whose students mostly live in dormitories and could practice together late into the night. That wasn’t an option for many of our students, so they wanted to start rehearsing early and squeeze in every possible minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And gradually, as five dry runs through the play turned into ten and then thirty, our Little Red Riding Hood was transformed from a series of missed cues and forgotten lines into an impressively polished production. There were moments, like when Red and her grandmother have a wordless cooking/dancing/drawing/boxing competition to determine who is the more suitable bride—just trust me on this—that would have been at home on a much larger stage, in front of a paying audience. Overall, the play was very good, the students’ effort evident in every scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, on competition day in mid-April, as we made our way to SMA Setiu, a religious school that was the site of this year’s drama showcase, there was no shaking the memories of years past, when TipTop’s drama teams were shown up by the better prepared elite schools. Our actors, generally an outgoing bunch, were unusually quiet that morning, and since we were slated to perform last, our nervousness—I was feeling nervous on the actors’ behalf—would be drawn out as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least it would be for the students, who had been sequestered behind the auditorium by Mr. Lokman, instructed to practice their lines and pay no mind to the other schools’ shows. But I was inside, watching everything from the front row, and with each school that dropped the curtains and took a bow, I grew more convinced that this was TipTop’s year. Even though the other plays were well done, I could tell that if our students performed as they had in rehearsal, TipTop would be the champions of Setiu district. When our turn came and my students began taking the stage, I reminded them to speak loudly, and wished them luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They didn’t need it. After weeks of work, all the blocking, scene changes, and singing came together seamlessly on stage. Fakril called Red Riding Hood “a 29-year-old woman,” Red’s worried mother implored God to make “her change,” not “she change,” and the fairy-dust-glitter that blessed the union of Grandmother and Big Bad Wolf twinkled down from the rafters at exactly the right moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed almost flawless, and for all the nerves I felt before the performance, there were none when the judges adjourned to tally the scores. We’d won easily, and it felt like only a formality when the emcee called out “TipTop Juara!” and the students rushed back on stage to collect their championship trophies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me, I was of course immensely proud of my students, and though I’ll always prefer a more traditional rendition of Red Riding Hood, any misgivings I had about our play’s message were put to rest while talking to the students outside the auditorium, after they got their trophies. Working on the script a month prior, I’d been tempted to tone down the scorn heaped on Red Riding Hood, maybe throw in a line about marriage not being the absolute fulfillment of a woman’s potential on earth, but I realized how completely I missed the point when one of the fairies approached me, trophy in hand, and started telling me how worried she was before the day’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think we would lost and an elite school would win,” she said. “Now I see TipTop can win Setiu district, and I think we can win Terengganu also.” I told her I agreed, and it struck me that this girl, dressed in all pink everything with fairy wings and a halo, had just spelled out the real moral of our story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;——&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sizzling you hear is the cockles of my heart, man.&lt;/p&gt;
