<p>Two weekends ago, ETA Shalene hosted a women&rsquo;s leadership camp that included, among many other activities that were rewarding for both students and teachers, a relationship q&amp;a session with the male ETAs in attendance. Sixty girls, ages 16 and 17, were given the chance to ask any question, no matter how personal or probing or hopelessly problematized by the vicissitudes of love, the intricacies of the human heart, before a panel of sensitive, knowledgeable men, two-thirds of whom were me and Fro. If you&rsquo;re already laughing, you got the right idea here.</p>

<p>The girls submitted their questions in writing. Truly, no topic was off limits.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t even read aloud to my fellow panelists this earnest and perfectly reasonable question without falling apart in a bout of convulsive laughterâ€”which was probably all the answer the questioner needed. Dudes is jerks, I dunno.</p>

<p>Also of interest: Why boys likes girlfriends more than sisters?</p>
<p>The most perceptive question we received actually wasn&rsquo;t a question at all. It was instead an unsolicited comment that had all of us on the panel, but especially Jake, nodding our heads in agreement.</p>

<p>Well thank you. High time I got a little recognition around here.</p>
