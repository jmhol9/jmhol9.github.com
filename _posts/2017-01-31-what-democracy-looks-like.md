As first reported in my last post:

> A new [Rasmussen Reports](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/immigration/january_2017/most_support_temporary_ban_on_newcomers_from_terrorist_havens) national telephone and online survey finds that 57% of Likely U.S. Voters favor a temporary ban on refugees from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen…

57% for the refugee ban, 33% opposed. As for temporarily blocking all citizens of the listed countries from entering the country, 56% are in favor, 32% against. Not even close.

The premise of republican democracy is that at some point, policy yields to the will of the people. Delay that point far enough, and you get a correction like the one Trump is now presiding over. It’s interesting to note how the American left believes in majority rule when it comes to Presidential elections, but is endlessly contemptuous of public opinion on issues like immigration.

Anyway, my final thought on the matter is this. If you were asked to devise a policy that encapsulates the callous arrogance and obliviousness of American liberalism circa January 2017, you couldn’t do any better than angrily insisting that Yemenis and Somalis and Libyans *must be* resettled in Wisconsin.
