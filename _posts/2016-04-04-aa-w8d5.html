<p>Scheme is&hellip; coming along! It turns out that building a web app is lots of work, and that it&rsquo;s difficult to predict how long it will take to implement a particular feature.</p>

<p>Since my last entry, I&rsquo;ve redone the auth process in React, added drag-n-drop uploads for user avatars, added a simple splash page, and enabled assignment of tasks to particular users.</p>

<p>The goal today: Finish the CSS styles for the task assignment dropdown, add the date selector, and add tasks comments. I really need to move to organizations (and, time permitting, projects) tomorrow, so tonight may be a late one.</p>
