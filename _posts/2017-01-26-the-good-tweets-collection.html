<p>One of the enduring effects of my time at the student newspaper is a nagging sense that when something seems dumb, I haven't yet gotten the full story. Newspaper writing is very humble work in the respect that, before pronouncing anyone an idiot (or saying much else about them), you have to go ask their side of the story.</p>
<p>Much of the least interesting writing today comes from journalists who don't bother with that basic legwork. You can pick out their work by its flat snark, which is missing the texture that comes from understanding something in its proper context. Snark <em>with</em> that texture is great but rare.</p>
