<p>The advantages of chucking your infant child the first time it causes you any grief are too obvious to need listing.</p>
<p>But are there disadvantages, too? Yes in fact. They&rsquo;re just easy to overlook, which is why the Malaysian government has printed these enlightening public service announcements detailing the perils of tossing out your baby.</p>

<p>Dead/unhealthy baby. Guilt. Dangerous overnourishment of the nation&rsquo;s stray animal population. Don&rsquo;t rush into discarding your baby behind the nearest goat curry stall without first figuring these cons into your decision making process.</p>
<p>On a more serious note, what does it say about a country when its people need PSAs convincing them not to abandon their babies? Or, which I bet is the more likely case here, when its government inexplicably thinks the people need such convincing? Families here must average eight, maybe nine kids.</p>
