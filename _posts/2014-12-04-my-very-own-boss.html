<p>The second job I ever held was at a ski mountain, where I operated a training lift on the kiddie hill. The slope was no longer than 40 feet and had all of 12 inches&rsquo; elevation change from top to bottom, so unless I helped them get moving, the kids, mostly three and four-year olds, would stand idly by me after disembarking the lift. I didn&rsquo;t mind that—it was lonely at the top of the hill, and they were good company—but the kids could only learn so much about skiing while chatting with me about last night&rsquo;s episode of Nancy Grace or whatever else crossed my mind. So to facilitate the lesson I&rsquo;d give them a gentle push downhill and say &ldquo;Whee,&rdquo; figuring the sound effect amplified their enjoyment.</p>
<p>It seemed to me no harm could come of that until one day, in a stroke of considerable ingenuity, a kid managed to break his arm while sliding steadily down the imperceptible incline. I didn&rsquo;t see the accident, but I did observe the confusion and wailing that followed. Most of the wails came from the kid&rsquo;s father, who was becoming increasingly upset at this child who dared impose a simple fracture—not even compound, not one inch of bone visible through the skin!—on his family&rsquo;s vacation.</p>
<p>My boss, who arrived to handle the situation, waved me over to the scene, where he told me the kid, sensing his father&rsquo;s rising anger I suppose, had turned state and fingered me as the guy who shoved him down the hill and caused the injury. I protested that a friendly starter push was standard operating procedure on the kiddie slope, but no dice. On the incident report, my name would appear in the &ldquo;employee(s) at fault&rdquo; blank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just be lucky you didn&rsquo;t kill somebody,&rdquo; my boss, whose pastimes included driving company snowmobiles while tripping on prescription muscle relaxants, said solemnly, then dismissed me for the day.</p>
<p>On my next performance evaluation, the boss hand-wrote, &ldquo;Be gentle with are customers there fragele.&rdquo; I stared at it slack-jawed, amazed by how close he&rsquo;d come to the actual spelling of fragile.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incidents like that which informed my view that in the working world, as in the Legend of Zelda, the only real problems are the bosses. (Excepting my current boss; I often wonder if he&rsquo;s more wise, or more handsome.)</p>
<p>There are other challenges, puzzles to solve, co-workers to stealthily sneak past at lunch break, and sometimes the office space approximates a medieval dungeon, but it would be almost pleasant if there weren&rsquo;t the constant risk of a boss coming along, breathing fire down your neck, docking your pay, and in the rare case unjustly implicating you in the reckless endangerment of a minor.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s the view I held for most of my working life. Then I tried working for myself for a summer and being my own boss.</p>
<p>I was excited to start. After chafing under Scrooges and Fagins, I told myself I&rsquo;d be a chill boss, and boy was I right. Within a week I&rsquo;d upped my fringe benefits to include twice daily naps, parfait breaks (since I don&rsquo;t smoke cigarettes), and all the Farmville I cared to play, which was a lot. When I instituted Hawaiian Shirt Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, my roommate called me out, and rightly so.</p>
<p>The problem was that I&rsquo;ve been finely tuned to work for a boss. Teachers, of course, are bosses of a type, as are parents and any other authority figure. My experience was those people conjured up a hoop, and I jumped through it with acrobatic aplomb. I&rsquo;ve got stacks of certificates—embossed with gold seals and signed by principals, pastors, rec-league soccer coaches—to show anyone who doubts my hoop-jumping bona fides.</p>
<p>In that respect, I&rsquo;m probably not alone on this campus. But sometime between all the certificate presentation ceremonies, I guess we were meant to develop internal standards of our own, which could serve in lieu of, or in addition to, bosses and their expectations. Many of us did; I&rsquo;ve never before encountered creativity and independent initiative like that which abounds here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not inevitable, though. There are activities I enjoy and things I want to accomplish, but for now I better hope those things coincide with my boss&rsquo;s goals. Outside the strictures of a job and with no supervisor in sight, I&rsquo;m only too happy to watch the morning&rsquo;s third rerun of SportsCenter or those Youtube videos that kept me occupied through the seemingly interminable stretches between parfait breaks.</p>
<p>I especially enjoyed the videos of friends playing jokes on friends. My favorite surely is the one where <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw7RxrozfO4" target="_blank">a guy finds a dead bird</a>, places it in a box of cereal, and then films the reaction as the bird plops into his roommate&rsquo;s morning bowl of Raisin Bran.</p>
<p>Not only is it high comedy, it&rsquo;s inspirational: I&rsquo;d work for any boss who required an employee to make a film like that, but I know that&rsquo;s not why the prankster did it. He had only the raw joy of action and creation to motivate him, and that was sufficient.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1417571237208_1524">I passed a quiet moment savoring that idea after watching the dead bird prank, then clicked to one of the suggested videos, which the auteur, DarkKoala, had titled simply, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaI-0e-qmgc" target="_blank">Revenge For Dead Bird Prank</a>.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a good one; I recommend it, next time you&rsquo;re looking for something to do.</p>
