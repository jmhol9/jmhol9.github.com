Why are liberals fighting Trump on refugees? Accepting refugees from countries like Syria, Iraq, and Yemen is not popular.* There are better ways to help people in those countries. A sane left, whose goal was not opposing President Trump but rather advancing its values, would not waste time trying to convince America that importing Syrians serves the national interest.

But the point is not to advance liberal values. It is to stoke outrage and obstruct the President at every turn. (When the right took a similar tack during the previous administration, it was less disruptive because conservatives are less prone to marching in the streets and don’t control the mainstream media.)

This is why the issue is presented as an absurd choice between resettling refugees in the United States, and ignoring them. Sensible alternatives, such as increased support for refugee camps in areas affected by the refugee ban, are not mentioned.

Never mind that such a plan would benefit more refugees than resettlement ever could. Never mind that it would be great PR for America. Never mind that, unlike resettlement, it would draw bipartisan support in Congress and from the electorate.

Championing a compromise like that would require ceding an inch to President Trump, so the left won’t do it.

*Here’s [one poll](https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2416) that shows as much. Google it and there’s a bunch more.
