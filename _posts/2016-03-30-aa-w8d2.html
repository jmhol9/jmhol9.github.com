<p>Today we began our capstone projects. My Asana clone now includes a very attractive user registration page and&hellip; nothing else.</p>

<p>Throughout this two-week process I&rsquo;ll be writing each component to completion, including CSS, before moving on to the next. As components go, the registration page (and its near-mirror image, the login page) were easy going. I expect to spend the rest of the week on the Task Index and Task Detail, which have many more moving parts.</p>
