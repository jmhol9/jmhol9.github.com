<p><span>I call this one </span><em>Do It Suck? : The Expatriate Experience in Malaysia as a Function of Aircon and Available Alcohol: A Pictograph</em><span>.</span></p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1417482965091_2870">(w/ apologies to Ms. Tina Lee, whose method of drawing betudung&rsquo;d Malaysian women I ripped off, and badly.)</p>
<p>There are places in Malaysia where I could live long term, places I&rsquo;d go back to next year willingly, even happily, if I had the chance. I don&rsquo;t live within six hours of any of these places, but that&rsquo;s not to say they aren&rsquo;t around. So rather than trying to squeeze all Malaysia into the category of &ldquo;do suck&rdquo; or &ldquo;don&rsquo;t suck,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve made this general rubric for estimating expat satisfaction from place to place.</p>
<p>By the way, the alcohol thing holds even if you don&rsquo;t drink—maybe especially if you don&rsquo;t drink, since my experience is that a couple strong ones will ease interactions with even the stone soberest of Malaysians. If there&rsquo;s no alcohol around, it&rsquo;s because all your neighbors are card-carrying (yeah, literally) Muslims who would be arrested if they were caught buying, selling, or drinking the stuff. Or if they were caught drinking water before sundown during Ramadan. Or if they were caught not carrying their Muslim cards. They&rsquo;re people who live every day of their lives under threat of arrest for acting like people, and who, more often than not, wouldn&rsquo;t have things any other way.* Alcohol is the canary in the coal mine, one tiny but reliable indicator of a thousand other, more pertinent cultural issues. So you yourself could be a Mormon teetotaler, but if you&rsquo;re stuck in some kampong where you can drive an hour in any direction and not once pass a store selling booze, then God bless you, it&rsquo;s gonna be a long damn year.</p>
<p>*But there&rsquo;s a massive generational gap on this. The kids are vastly more engaged with the outside world than their parents. Students tell me all the time that they want to visit New York City, for example. I rarely hear that from the other teachers, but a number of teachers have said they could never visit New York because it doesn&rsquo;t have halal food. (One teacher who did visit New York a couple years back told me he boiled and ate potatoes in his hotel room every night.) My guess is that the internet and five hundred channels of satellite television are prying open a culture that would rather remain closed.</p>
