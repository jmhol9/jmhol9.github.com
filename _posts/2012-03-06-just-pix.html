<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1417488341622_2344">I have two ways to gauge the success of my lessons at SMK T.I.</p>
<p>The first is how loud the kids clap when I leave the classroom. They always applaud as I walk off, which is just one among the many similarities between  being a multi-platinum recording artist in the United States and being a white man in Terengganu, but an especially well-executed lesson can take the usual pro forma ovation and turn it all the way up, till I feel like I&rsquo;m Joakim throwing down on Paul Pierce <em>[JH- this reference was topical at the time it was written]</em>.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s nice, but it can get better. The way I know I did it extra big is if the kids ask to take pictures with me before I leave. English basketball with my 2UIA class? Circle dramas with 5UM? It was like a <em>GQ</em> cover shoot broke out after that shit. I can&rsquo;t say whether the students learned English or took away anything of value, but I do know for sure that I was in a lot of kids&rsquo; Facebook profile pictures the next day—and that, I believe, is the true measure of an educator.</p>
<p>I bring this up because this week Nick and I ran a game night at my school&rsquo;s hostel, and afterwards we could not stop taking pictures. The kids rushed us; they came at us from all sides. There were so many of them shoving camera phones at us, we could hardly sit down to eat our fried anchovies and rice in the hostel canteen, which maybe wasn&rsquo;t such a loss.</p>
<p>And the upshot is that I now have a ton of new photos, so I&rsquo;m gonna dump a few here. The games pictured have names and rules but those aren&rsquo;t important. What happened was the kids ran amok in the parking lot, body checking each other and falling down and, despite our insistence that it was &ldquo;English Game Night,&rdquo; shouting just about exclusively in Malay. Who ever said learning a second language has to be boring, or non-violent, or even involve a second language? <img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/LFueIMg.jpg"/></p>

<p>This game is called Where The West Wind Blows. It&rsquo;s like musical chairs, except vaguely educational.</p>
