<p>Never got her name, so now I&rsquo;ll never know it. To me she was Kuih Potong Girl, just that, who worked the early shift at the Petronas between Kg. Pak Kancil and school, who rung me up every morning when I stopped to buy my breakfast, same thing every day—kuih potong. Like fig newtons, but filled with red bean paste. Available also in durian flavor which, though not even vaguely durian flavored and hence better than expected, is not stocked at Petronas. Anyway I&rsquo;m partial to red bean. <i>Dua ringgits</i>, Kuih Potong Girl told me, every day.</p>
<p>Of course she was pretty or she wouldn&rsquo;t have been so much as Kuih Potong Girl, she would have been altogether nameless. I&rsquo;m an asshole in the most conventional ways. And she was easy company. I spoke and Kuih Potong Girl listened with dark, kind eyes that told me <i>boleh faham</i>—figuratively, y'know. Literally, I&rsquo;d say to her &ldquo;good morning&rdquo; and she&rsquo;d cock her head askance, like a chow chow being lectured on the social benefits of veganism.</p>
<p>Which, thank god. She spoke zero English and that was nine-tenths of why I liked her, her high cheekbones and the neat, square knots she tied in the bags that held my kuih potong notwithstanding. The people here who you <i>can</i> say things to and they understand and speak back in what mismatched vestiges of classroom English they yet retain, those are the people you <i>can&rsquo;t</i> say anything to. They&rsquo;ll be offended or they won&rsquo;t listen, they&rsquo;ll be caught up asking you the price of a Samsung Galaxy tablet in New York or the salary of an entry-level teacher in Chicago or the price of a visit to an entry-level prostitute in Chicago as compared to New York. It all comes to the same. You learn to quote them the prices they ask, and shut up.</p>
<p>Kuih Potong Girl was not like that. Talking to her in English was shouting into a howling void, and as for prices, the only prices that interested her were those of kuih potong and 95 Yellow, which she ascertained by means of a UPC scanner. She asked me no questions and I told her the unexpurgated truth. Things I would never speak aloud on school grounds, or to my landlord. That I hate the women who work at Caltex, the way they chide me for not speaking Malay and hassle me to buy the boiled corn cobs they sell from a bucket behind the counter—this came out, as though by reflex, one day as Kuih Potong Girl changed me three ones for a five. She didn&rsquo;t respond, didn&rsquo;t flinch. I got bolder. That teaching English to Malay students, ostensibly my purpose for being in Malaysia, seems actually a choice between struggling to communicate anything meaningful and clowning mindlessly for the students&rsquo; approval, I told her, and every day I choose the latter. That I now identify with all my teachers I ever judged to be indolent, pandering, interested only in whiling away the time till the bell. That I inadvertently—that is, by my constant repetition—taught the boys in 2UiTM, my worst class, to say &ldquo;oh my fucking god&rdquo; with exactly the inflection I use, exaggerating the <i>uhh</i> and swallowing it into the back of their throats so it comes out glottal and phlegmy. That to my knowledge, it is their only English phrase, and they deliver it now with such accustomed ease you might take them for fluent, if you heard only that. There was a measure of satisfaction in telling Kuih Potong Girl this.</p>
<p>That I do not have a wife or a girlfriend, I told her, nor can I say what maladaptive cocktail of defects in body and disposition has conspired to keep me, at my advanced age, now 25 and some months, without a partner in monogamy, and I don&rsquo;t understand the teachers&rsquo; limitless enthusiasm for discussing at length these things, which are for me sources only of shame and anxiety. That I, while blind drunk one night off gum-blistering bootleg liquor, like a hobo, lost my favorite shorts, that I wore every day, and awoke to find myself without phone, wallet, or ringgits, like a hobo, and now have to beg money for food, to cover my <i>teh ais</i>, which has a value in American dollars of just under 32 cents and I cannot unaided pay even that, like a—sweet Jesus I did not expect at the outset that this hobo analogy would fit so perfectly. That often I tell the teachers my plan for the weekend is to drive to a waterfall, because that connects us. There is evidently something about parking lots near waterfalls that speaks to the souls of Malays. But if I do drive to a waterfall, I won&rsquo;t hang out in the parking lot. Instead I find a path and walk past the spot, 75 meters from the parking lot, where the KFC-branded litter stops, the spot where all Malays turn back, and find a sunny patch among the trees and stand still and look up. That I have arrived at a point where reminding myself the sun has not yet flamed out means a great deal to me.</p>
<p>When the time came, I kind of wanted to tell her, in Malay, that I was leaving, that I would never come back, not to the Petronas, and that I appreciated her listening to me even though she didn&rsquo;t understand. But how many people must come by her station every day? Men buying cigarettes, refueling their lorries, who hold real conversations with Kuih Potong Girl, where she speaks back. These visits to Petronas that felt so important from my side of the counter, they were just one wrinkle in a long day for her. So at the end I spoke once more in English she&rsquo;d never understand, and told her I was going home, and not to worry, I&rsquo;m a very happy person in America, back there I&rsquo;ll find a real job and girlfriend and drink responsibly, and still eat junk food for breakfast, if I&rsquo;m being realistic, but—my point is, thank you and goodbye. And when I was good and finished, she fixed me with a stare and said—</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sad day, lah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>—which, what? I look back and there&rsquo;s no processing that, no accounting for it. No way she could&rsquo;ve known to say those words.</p>
<p>Probably just a nonsense phrase, picked up years back from some English teacher who couldn&rsquo;t take this shit anymore.</p>
