<p><strong>Question: </strong>Do Malaysians eat dogs? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: An important issue for Americans, judging by how often it&rsquo;s brought up in conversation. I bet half the people I told about going to Malaysia made some reference to dog eating. Americans generally (and myself included until a few months ago) have only the foggiest notion what happens in Malaysia, but that notion definitely includes shih tzus roasting on an open fire. So I&rsquo;m gonna tackle this one on two fronts.</p>
<p>First, I don&rsquo;t know and haven&rsquo;t inquired, but I don&rsquo;t think Malaysians eat dogs. Something like 60 percent of the country identifies as Muslim, and since dogs are hygienically suspect in the Muslim tradition, I think eating them is out.</p>
<p>Second, let&rsquo;s imagine, just momentarily and for the sake of argument, that Malaysians did eat dogs. This question is always asked with a self-satisfied smirk, the questioner&rsquo;s chest visibly puffed, like to say, &ldquo;<em>Chalk up another one for America. Purple mountains, waves of grain, and the good sense not to eat dog meat</em>.&rdquo; Which, okay, times are tough in the U.S. and a country has to hang its hat on something, I just don&rsquo;t see how feeding, walking, grooming, medicating, housing, and seeing to our dogs&rsquo; every need for years on end places us higher on the Great Chain of Being than those people who simply eat their dogs and get the ordeal over with. I mean, as regard for canines goes, we Americans are the ones trading gold for glass beads, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a similar issue, though one not so frequently joked about, with our treatment of the chinchilla. People in this country will pay multiple thousands of dollars for coats made from chinchilla pelts, and chinchilla apparel of any type is a real status symbol in some circles (cf. &ldquo;What Happened to That Boy,&rdquo; by Birdman ft. Clipse, where in verse three Pusha T brags, &ldquo;My niece was four when she felt chinchilla&rdquo;).</p>
<p>I can only assume the existence of &ldquo;chinchilla-chic&rdquo; in America stems from a failure to understand what a chinchilla actually is: a varmint, like a hamster with overgrown ears. Maybe these chinchilla-wearing folks have never been to their neighborhood pet store and seen the chinchillas on sale there for $6.99, or two for $10. We&rsquo;re dealing with small rodents here, essentially rats with fuzzy tails—or in the chinchilla&rsquo;s native Peru, a light snack served corndog style (with a wooden roasting stick through the center). Here&rsquo;s a (as-yet-uncooked) chinchilla, for your consideration:</p>

<p>Now me, I favor leaving these fellas unmolested and in the wild, but if faced with the choice of 1) turning like 200 of them into a piece of glitterati couture or 2) roasting a few in the Peruvian fashion, then I say Option Two makes way more sense. An animal so small you can cradle it in your palm seems an improbable source of insulated outerwear, and let&rsquo;s face it, that chinchilla up there looks succulent. But we Americans turn up our noses at even the thought of eating a rodent, and so we&rsquo;ve chosen a different fate for our chinchillas, one that involves Fat Joe paying something like $10,000 for a powder blue chinchilla coat that he evidently wears while swimming.</p>

<p>Incredible. I bet Peruvians have a hearty laugh at our expense anytime this comes up in conversation.</p>
