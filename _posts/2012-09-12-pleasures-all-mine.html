<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1417482965091_2979">I&rsquo;d tell you they thought I was a ghost, but most Malays do believe in ghosts. I don&rsquo;t think these people fully believed they were seeing me.</p>
<p>My overnight bus left Johor Bahru a few ticks past eight o'clock. By 10:30 we were in Segamat, the capital of Jake&rsquo;s district; by two in the morning, we were approaching Cherating and Terengganu&rsquo;s southern border, still five hours south of Pak Kancil, where I live.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s around that time, two or three a.m., that most overnight buses stop for an hour so the bus driver can have a drink, the smokers can have a smoke, and any passengers struggling to sleep through the rattle of the windows or the drone of the driver&rsquo;s personal radio can step out and stretch their legs.</p>
<p>I usually sleep right through this night owl stop, but for some reason on Sunday, I woke up around 2:45 to find the bus idling by a roadside warong and decided to get out for a glass of <em>teh beng</em>: one part tea, one part ice, one and a half parts sweetened, condensed milk. Adult-onset diabetes in a blue plastic beer stein, and exactly to my tastes.</p>
<p>The bus dropped off half the passengers as we passed through Johor and Pahang, and those still en route were mostly asleep, so there was nobody in the warong but the driver, two Chinese guys likely on their way to Kota Bharu, the northern terminus of the bus route, and the four young ladies staffing the place.</p>
<p>Oh, and me. You can imagine how I looked getting off the bus: White skin, brown hair, pointy nose, wearing a Terengganu FC jersey, wiping the sleep from my brown eyes that could as well be neon purple for how often they draw comments around here. And walking into an unnamed, unmarked little warong at some hour long past midnight, in a place that gets no tourists and approaches 100-percent ethnic homogeneity. Like I say, a troop of ghosts hopping off the bus and ordering up some keropok would have been more expected. I&rsquo;m no expert in this but, judging from their faces as I approached, I think several employees dislodged their lower jaws in shock.</p>
<p>I was hardly awake and in no mood to explain how I came to be sitting in this warong outside Cherating, Pahang State, Malaysia, all the back story, plus can I speak Malay, do I have a girlfriend, how much is my salary. But of course the girls wanted to talk, and the bus driver too, he was also curious. Everything that was, to my mind, remarkable only for its mundanity was, to them, fresh and weird and interesting, probably the most memorable thing that happened to them all night. All week? Could be.</p>
<p>Encounters like this are a constant in Malaysia, each iteration differing slightly in its particulars but essentially the same. Here, I am interesting for the simple facts of who I am and where I am, and people approach me all the time, wanting to talk.</p>
<p>By now, I&rsquo;m never in the mood to go through the same question-and-answer routine again. Some of the people I do blow off. You can&rsquo;t talk to them all, but you can&rsquo;t dodge them all either. So when they start talking to me, I have to take over the conversation and bring them around to talking about themselves, their families, their culture or country. Each one is a new person I&rsquo;ve never spoken with before. They&rsquo;re bound to have something worth hearing. What effort I put into these encounters is almost always repaid, I think.</p>
<p>Such is not my life in America, where I&rsquo;m practically part of the landscape, another white guy who by all outward appearances is about as compelling as the fourth parking meter up there on the left. No one approaches me uninvited, hoping only to talk. Even if they come up because they want something from me, that&rsquo;s unusual. And for real, if a pretty girl walks over to me on the el and tells me my fly&rsquo;s undone, that&rsquo;s a red letter day in my book. I mean, I already got her looking at my crotch. But anyway!</p>
<p>I bring this up because of a Tumblr post that&rsquo;s been linked around Twitter and Facebook a lot lately. <a href="http://unwinona.tumblr.com/post/30861660109/i-debated-whether-or-not-to-share-this-story" target="_blank">Check it</a>. The woman writing tells how men will approach her on the train and ask about the book she&rsquo;s reading. She&rsquo;s annoyed by this and blames it on a mindset in which, “<em>I somehow, as a woman, owe you [men] conversation.</em>”</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s how she feels, okay. I&rsquo;m confident I&rsquo;m approached more times in a week here than she is in a month, so I more than sympathize with the feeling of <em>not again</em> that comes from yet another person sidling up with a smile and a question.</p>
<p>I only want to say that, as for me, someone who has lived both sides of this, I know that people wanting to meet you is not bad. It is not, on balance, a problem or impediment or a cross to bear. It is, rather, an enormously good thing.</p>
<p>However much I grimace when some wizened Malay man wants to know the price of chartering a fishing tour of Lake Michigan, or whether rice is too expensive for Americans to eat regularly, or why African-Americans insist on importing methamphetamine into Terengganu by way of Thailand, I will miss those conversations once I&rsquo;m home and humdrum again. I&rsquo;m not quite an extrovert but I do appreciate that other people are simply the most interesting thing going, far better than any website or mountain vista, better even than the best miniseries on premium cable. The opportunity to meet many people effortlessly, even when they come to you with an agenda, is a rare gift. It is enriching and enlivening and, even when it&rsquo;s maddening, ultimately worth it.</p>
<p>Worth it in a way one might not appreciate if she&rsquo;s never blended in.</p>
<p>Sunday night, one of the girls working the warong told me she knows a player on Terengganu FC. A cousin or something; I couldn&rsquo;t totally understand. She said he likes the coach, an Englishman, and wishes his teammates weren&rsquo;t chasing the guy off. Another one explained to me the different styles of tudungs and head coverings: Which are considered more stylish among young women, better for hot weather, acceptable only for the very old. How to dress up a simple tudung with a sheer, patterned scarf, as she and the other employees had done. It was a nice look, one I&rsquo;d seen but never really noticed before. We spoke in Malay and I probably learned a couple words without realizing. At the end, I gave them my Facebook name and they comp&rsquo;d my teh beng. The driver and I got back on the bus, and I was asleep once more before we pulled away from the curb.</p>
