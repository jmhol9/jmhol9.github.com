<p>Today I started by reviewing the steps I followed yesterday to make Rails Lite… and now I think I understand (roughly) what happens when a Rails app receives an HTTP request. The full writeup is forthcoming—doubtless you’ve been waiting with bated breath—but before that, two thoughts:</p>

<ol><li><p>As with Active Record Lite—our DIY database query library—almost everything about Rails Lite is straightforward and surprisingly simple, once you take the time to look through it and write a big chunk of the code yourself. I’m sure the implementation is extremely clever, and I’m not saying it would occur to <strong>me</strong> to do things this way without a lot of prompting. But, having seen it done, I think I could recreate it.</p></li>
<li><p>In Ruby (and hence in Rails), everything really is an object. Even the routes are objects! I think my instinct would have been to include the routing details in the Router object itself, perhaps using some a hash with arrays of each route’s parameters. That could work, but it would not be the OOProgrammer’s way.</p></li>
</ol>
