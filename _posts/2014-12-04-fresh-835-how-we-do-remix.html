<p><i>This video, together with the annotated lyrics below, is the best encapsulation of my time in Malaysia that I’ve got.<br/></i></p><p><i>Fro and I had misgivings about doing this, even though it was recorded at time when white people making funny raps wasn’t entirely played out. But, our target demo—fellow ETAs enduring 10 months in Malaysia—loved it, and if attempting to teach Malay kids taught me nothing else, it’s that you got to give the people what they want.</i></p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_2OuCi7E5JA" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><p><i>[50 CENT / CHORUS]</i><br/><b>THIS IS HOW WE DO (4X)</b></p><p><i>[FRO2000]</i><br/><b>BOLEH, UNHH, TAK BOLEH, UNHH</b><br/>In Malay, “boleh” is can and “tak boleh” is cannot. Take a beat to memorize that.</p><p>Cool, you now speak rudimentary Malay. Boleh and tak boleh are way more useful than can and cannot are in English, and knowing both will get you through many simple conversations. For example, here’s a translated sentence my landlady said the other day while explaining that she waited five years after getting married to have her first son, Zaquan.</p><p>Landlady: When I was nineteen, I married Datuk Sabri. Five years later, can Zaquan.</p><p>Boleh, tak boleh: two words, endless possibilities.</p><p><b>ROTI CANAI, CAN OF 100 PLUS</b><br/>Roti canai is a flat bread served at lots of Malay and Malaysian-Indian restaurants. It can be chewy or crunchy and stuffed with everything from egg to onion to condensed milk, but most commonly it comes chewy and without any filling. Very popular among the ETA crowd, but I think it’s about the same as eating plain tortillas and usually skip it.</p><p>100 Plus is an isotonic drink. There are lots of isotonic drinks—Revive, 99 Plus—available here, but 100 Plus is the gold standard. It’s nothing like Gatorade but it is marketed at athletes so I’d say the closest American analog is Gatorade. Malays in my parts don’t really care for 100 Plus, or fizzy drinks in general. Fruit juice is more their thing. </p><p><b>SAY, “DO YOU LIKE DURIAN?” AND I’M LIKE, “UMMM…”</b><br/>Durian is a odorous fruit that, to the American palate, kinda suck. Malaysians love it so much that here it has been unironically styled the King of Fruits. </p><p><b>EARLY A.M., “GOOD MORNING, SUH”</b><br/>“Suh” = Sir. This is how students greet us, and not only in the early A.M. Good morning is perfectly acceptable in the mid afternoon or late evening, as well. </p><p><b>IN THE CLASSROOM, GOTTA CHEAT TO PLAY,</b><br/>Cheating is rampant here, to the point that I think it’s less cheating and more an utter disregard for the rules. </p><p>Example: I’ve tried to play a game where one student sits in front of the class, I hold up a word behind his head, and his teammates have to describe the word until he guesses it. It doesn’t work because the moment you hold up the word, multiple kids will read it aloud. That happens every single time. </p><p>And then the kids will be like, “Suh, why would we describe this word? We just told him what it is,” and suddenly I’m noticing how all the students have such thin, highly-wringable necks. </p><p><b>GIVE PROPS, NO GRAMMAR, BUT THE KID GOT GAME</b><br/>The quality of the English spoken here is low. Real low. </p><p><b>“ADA GULA-GULA?” “TAK ADA” IS WHAT I SAY</b><br/>“Ada gula-gula” = Do you have candy? </p><p>“Tak ada” = Screw off, kid. </p><p><b>WHAT’S THE DEAL WITH THE BIEBS IN MALAYSIA? IT’S A SHAME.</b><br/>Malaysia has Bieber Fever for sure. I don’t see what’s so wrong with that. I guess Fro’s got a different take. </p><p><b>ETA, HONDA WAVE</b><br/>ETA is short for English Teaching Assistant, the title given to Fulbright English teachers worldwide. Malaysia is a little unusual in that we lead classes, often without another teacher in the classroom (or any of the adjacent classrooms), and most other places Fulbrighters assist the main teacher.</p><p>The Honda Wave is a popular motorbike. I myself push a Kriss, which is made by Modenas, a domestic company. Interestingly, “pushing a whip” takes on a new and way-less figurative meaning when you purchase your motor vehicle from one of Malaysia’s several terrible car manufacturers. </p><p><b>NO INTERNATTY LICENSE SO POLICE GET PAID</b><br/>Unlike ya boy, Jake is driving here without an international license, which could conceivably mean paying a bribe to some wayward po, but realistically Malaysian cops are never gonna hassle a white guy. They love us too much. </p><p><b>WHEN I CRASH THE BIKE, “IS MR. JACK OKAY?”</b><br/>Jake (mispronounced “Jack”) and I are among the dwindling few ETAs who have avoided motorbike wrecks altogether. My roommate Nick had two crashes in three weeks on his bike, the second of which tore off his front mudguard and has left him bike-less for a couple months now. </p><p><b>YOU WANT AN OMELETTE, GOTTA CRACK SOME EGGS</b><br/>During orientation, one of the ETAs spoke at a meeting with the national Ministry of Education and in his speech compared Malaysia to an omelette. Cause it’s got a lot of different ingredients in it, but they all blend deliciously into a coherent whole. While that’s an impossibly idealized metaphor for Malaysia’s mostly unsuccessful efforts towards harmonizing its Malay, Chinese, and Indian populations, it was hilarious to hear this guy call Malaysia an omelette in front of all these officials, and in our little circle, the omelette has become the emblem of our adopted home. </p><p><b>SAY, Y’ALL GOT TAUGEH? I’M A STRICT VEGETARIAN</b><br/>Taugeh is like tofu, I think, and available in Jake’s majority Chinese town. You walk into one of my local Malay restaurants and ask for this mess and they will start laughing at you slightly harder than they already were, and then serve you a nice hot bowl of vegetable soup which, by volume, is mostly fish balls and beef tripe. </p><p><b>Y’ALL GOT TIGER? TIOMAN, RIDE THE FERRY IN</b><br/>Tiger is a popular Malaysian beer. For some reason, the islands (like Tioman) are able to sell beer more cheaply than most of the rest of the country, where it is sin-taxed straight to hell. </p><p><b>J-SOUTH, T-CREW, PAHANG, I GOT YOU</b><br/>Johor, which is the southernmost state, plus Terengganu and Pahang. The three Malaysian states (out of fourteen total) that have Fulbright ETAs this year. </p><p><b>CAUSE HOW MANY FULBRIGHTS? COUNT ‘EM, IT’S SATU</b><br/>“Satu” = one. A reference to “Satu Malaysia,” a government campaign to decrease racial tensions within Malaysia. Also to the sometimes cliquey-ness of the ETA group. We mostly hang out with other people placed in our various states. Here, Fro asks that we move past that, and toward the ideal of Satu Fulbright.</p><p>I too support that, as long as I don’t gotta talk to nobody from Pahang. </p><p><i>[J. HOLLIDAY]</i><br/><b>SWEATIN LIKE IT’S 92 IN THE SHADE,</b><br/>92 In The Shade is a book, a movie, and a common temperature in Malaysia.</p><p><b>SUNBURNT, LOOK LIKE I NEED A FIRE BRIGADE,</b><br/>On Tuesdays, all students at all Malaysian secondary schools participate in co-curricular clubs, which have names like “Police Cadets” and “Islamic Princesses” to make them sound more appealing than what they actually are, which is groups of kids marching in formation during the hottest part of the afternoon. Luckily, co-curricular activities are cancelled at least 80 percent of the time. </p><p>Anyway, one of these co-curricular clubs is the Fire Brigade. </p><p><b>SHE SAID, “THAT AIN’T HALAL WITH MAT SALLEH”</b><br/>“Halal” = permitted under the rules of Islam. “Mat salleh” = the preferred term for white men. </p><p><b>WHEN I ASKED WHY HER TOP UP IF SHE AIN’T GOT PREPAID</b><br/>Adding more credit to your prepaid phone is called topping up, or buying top up. Prepaid phones are common here, but some people use postpaid instead. </p><p>I was appalled to learn certain listeners took this and the previous line for some kind of bawdy double entendre. <i>Please. </i></p><p><b>YOU KNOW I’M ROTI-GREASY, BATIK-STEEZY,</b><br/>Roti canai is greasy. In the rap lexicon, it’s hard to pinpoint just what greasy means, but you definitely want to be it.</p><p>Batik is the fabric used to make baju batiks, the colorful shirts I have to wear every Thursday. Steez, needless to say, is style + ease. </p><p><b>AND STILL DOWN FOR SOME PORK LIKE A ANGRY BIRRRRRD</b><br/>There’s no explaining this line because unless you experience it, there’s no understanding how central to Malaysian culture the Angry Birds have become. They are everywhere. Classrooms. Toothpastes. The flip flops of grown men.</p><p>Also, in the game, the cartoon birds fall down, out of the sky, in order to blow up these pigs, and I still really like eating pork, even if it’s not often available here. </p><p><b>AND YOU KNOW EVEN WHEN I JET</b><br/>We travel a lot. </p><p><b>T-CREW ON MY BRAIN, STAY REPPIN OMELETTE</b><br/>I’m about to eat an omelette tonight, come to think of it. </p><p><b>IN TERENGGANJU, MY BLOCK’S SETIU,</b><br/>Here’s a story. For all his wonderful qualities, Nick, my roommate, is no linguist. At some point he got the idea that the name of our state, Terengganu, was pronounced Terenggan-ju. With a J. Somehow this mistaken impression lasted all through orientation in KL, where we heard the correct pronunciation three times a day, and through nine tenths of the Terengganu orientation, where we heard it a whole lot more.</p><p>During the KL orientation, we met Prime Minister Najib, and he asked each of us which state we would be in. His exchange with Nick went like this:</p><p><i>Prime Minister Najib</i>: What state will you be in?<br/><i>Roommate Nick</i>: Terengganju<br/><i>PMN</i>: Oh good, Terengganu!<br/><i>RN</i>: Yes, Terengganju.</p><p>Things escalated when we got to Terengganu and Nick was named leader of the seventeen Terengganu ETAs. This meant he was asked to give brief remarks whenever we had a meeting with anybody. Like on the day that we visited a primary school, then a secondary school, and finally the state department of education, and Nick told each of them how happy we were to at last be in Terengganju. </p><p>That night, we had a barbecue with teachers from all of our schools, plus a bunch of state officials, so of course Nick was asked to speak. At the last minute, as he was walking to the podium, one of the other ETAs decided she’d had enough. That man had to be stopped, and now. She pulled him aside.</p><p>Nick, she said, it’s Terengganu. Gah-new. There’s no J.</p><p>Nick nodded.</p><p>I’d like to tell you Nick nailed it that night, but this is life, not Disney, and old habits die hard. But Nick worked at it, and it wasn’t long before he kicked his J habit altogether. </p><p><b>ME AND NEEK SHUTTIN THE WARONGS DOWN</b><br/>“Neek” is just Nick plus a Malay accent. Once, he and I went to the beach with my mentor, and en route Nick said he planned to survey the beach as a possible site for a clean up by his newly-formed Environmental Club. Regrettably, we found the beach mostly clear of litter, but there were some clumps of seaweed, so my mentor walked over to one and said, “Look! A trash! For Mr. Neek!” And so was a nickname born.</p><p>Warongs are open-air roadside restaurants. I usually say I eat at restaurants, not warongs, but if you ask the Malays around here, there aren’t really any restaurants in Setiu, since restaurants have four walls and a door and no feral cats wandering through. We don’t have anything that fancy. My area’s nicest restaurant, and this is by a wide margin, has a row of potted shrubs to shield it from the noise of passing traffic and one duck that patrols the floor, keeping crumbs to a minimum. </p><p><b>GOT NOTHING TO DO CEPT MAKAN BUDU,</b><br/>“Makan” = eat, pronounced “mah-kay” in one of the local dialects. “Budu” = a fish sauce made by dissolving sardines in salt water.</p><p>There’s not much popping off around here. Terengganu’s slogan is something like “Where heritage meets nature,” which is the glass-half-full spin on a place where there’s nothing but people living very much as they did 150 years ago, only now with a lot more Facebook and diesel engines. </p><p>One part of the area’s heritage is budu, a sauce made from dissolved fish. Terengganans and their neighbors to the north, Kelantanians, take great pride in their budu. I don’t know if the stuff is originally from this area, but I can’t imagine there are many competing claimants to the title of “Budu’s Birthplace,” so it might be ours by default. During my first three or four months here, I’d rarely go two straight days without someone asking if I liked budu. I’d be sitting there at school, making a lesson plan or reading the paper, and some teacher or student would come up and, without preface, demand that I render judgment on budu.</p><p>“Suh! You like budu?” </p><p>As a condiment, it’s mighty alright. As something to stir Malays into a hilarious frenzy of excitement, budu is perfect. It was available in the canteen one day in April and all morning there was an endless train of people walking past my desk, asking if I planned to go eat budu at lunch. When I finally did, the scene was like something from an old fashioned Baptist revival. Women were shouting, laughing, shrieking from their seats—that is, when they managed to keep their seats. At least half needed to run over to the buffet and point out the small bowl where I could get a few teaspoons of budu, which is all you need. </p><p>Of course, a proper revival has that moment of truth when the preacher steps away from the old lady in the wheelchair and the room holds its breath, waiting to see if she’ll rise to her feet, if God indeed works miracles among us. In this case, that happened when I pushed some rice into the puddle of budu on my plate, took a bite, savored it for a moment, swallowed it down, and then, all eyes on me, confirmed for the waiting audience that white rice and fish water is truly “betul, betul sedap.” Really, really delicious. A cry went up from the crowd. </p><p>Praise be. </p><p><b>AND GO OUT PASSING MY BIZ CARDS ROUND</b><br/>I heard a lot of guff from the other ETAs after I paid Rm 50 for 200 of the gaudiest business cards you can imagine. Unfortunately, I have to skip the backstory on this one other than to say: Who’s laughing now, Dungun? </p><p><b>SO I KNOCK BACK MILO, STACK GREEN LIKE CEE-LO,</b><br/>Cee Lo Green. Green money. This line isn’t my favorite since Malaysian money is lots of different colors, and the biggest bills in wide circulation are blue. w/e. Milo is a popular chocolate drink, a little bit like Yoo-Hoo, and often served hot. </p><p><b>ROLL THROUGH THE PASAR, KUIH BY THE KILO,</b><br/>“Pasar” = market. Week markets (once or twice a week during the day) and night markets (at night) pop up around most Malaysian towns. Kuih (“kway”) are finger foods, usually sweets made from flour and rice, but sometimes fried and savory, kind of like pizza puffs or egg rolls. You can get them in markets and at some warongs. </p><p><b>MIGHT HIT CHERATING, LIL BALI GET REAL LOW</b><br/>Cherating is a resort town in northern Pahang, just below the Terengganu–Pahang border. Though almost six hours’ drive away, it is home to Little Bali, the nearest nightclub that serves alcohol (rumors of a BYOB disco in Kuala Terengganu circulate, but are as yet unconfirmed by this correspondent). Little Bali is a good place to meet bad Muslims who do things like dance, drink beer, and enjoy live music. </p><p><b>BROKE FELLAS IN JOHOR, LET ME KNOW HOW THAT FEELS, YO</b><br/>There are major differences between the states where ETAs are placed. Johor has several large cities with nightlife, movie theaters, air conditioned restaurants, Chinese people, and other attractions completely or almost completely absent from Terengganu. All those inducements to spend money left some of the Johor ETAs nearly broke by the middle of April. Their complaining on Facebook didn’t get a lot of sympathy from those of us up north, who have nothing to spend our money on except bags of kuih and cups of Milo. The truth is that if I could move to Johor, I’d do it yesterday. Until then, I’ll stick to making fun of those kids for blowing all their money. </p><p><i>[50 CENT / CHORUS]</i></p><p><i>[FRO2000]</i><br/><b>I GOT NASI ON THE PLATE, INCLUDING THE TEA TIMES</b><br/>Full Malay hospitality stipulates there ought to be six meals served each day: breakfast, mid-morning tea, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner, and late night tea. Rice is available at most or all of these meals, since things like chicken, beans, and sandwiches are considered “not food” (direct quote from one of my teachers) when served without rice. </p><p><b>WE’RE BOOKIN THE BINTANG, WE’RE SEEIN THE SUN RISE</b><br/>MACEE, the organization that oversees the Malaysian Fulbright program, has its headquarters in the Bukit Bintang area of KL, so we stayed there during orientation and the midyear meeting, and it’s the part of the city I know best. Sun up here is around 7:30 most days, so you’re going pretty hard if you make it to sunrise. </p><p><b>THE MOB DROPS THE DOC WHEN WE AIN’T DOIN IT RIGHT</b><br/>I think this is something about ministry officials in Johor (where Jake’s based) referring to “the document” when they want ETAs to do something differently. This document, which is the authoritative take on what ETAs are supposed to do, is for government eyes only, so it cannot be shown to MACEE or the ETAs, but it may be quoted freely by Malaysian officials looking to win arguments with us. </p><p>Like I say, I don’t really know. I haven’t gotten any feedback on my teaching all year long. Not a single word. It’s hard for me to imagine my mentor telling me I couldn’t teach a certain lesson, or couldn’t take a personal day, or couldn’t leave school whenever I feel like it. On the other hand, there’s a girl 30 minutes north of me whose mentor doesn’t let her leave school until 4 pm—two hours after all the real teachers are free to go. The ETAs’ experiences with school administrators and the bureaucracy in general seem to vary widely, and I’ve been pretty lucky in mine. </p><p><b>LATE NIGHTS, Y’ALL KNOW I’M TOWN FOR LIFE</b><br/>Umm… </p><p><b>YO, HOV, THE EMCEE? HE GOT AC?</b><br/>“Hov” = me. Sure do got AC. It hums along most nights at a brisk 18 degrees celsius, or 64.4 fahrenheit, which is why I’m surely one of the very few people in Malaysia who sleeps in a hoodie, thermal tights, and wool socks, all underneath a heavy comforter. When you spend your days sweating through your necktie, a nice cold room feels like Shangri-La.</p><p><b>SUN UP MALAYSIAN HUNDRED HEAT DON’T PHASE ME</b><br/>I haven’t heard such ridiculous bragging in a rap song since Birdman got on 100 Million Dollars and claimed to be a billionaire. Fro is the sweatiest man alive when he’s living in Chicago. Kids here come up to him and ask if he’s sick, if he needs to see a doctor. He has to wear an IV drip of 100 Plus at all times. </p><p><b>AND SHOUT OUT TO MACEE, OLIVIA CRAZY</b><br/>Olivia works for MACEE. She was an ETA last year. </p><p><b>TIPPIN BACK BOTTLES AND WE SWAGGIN LIKE RAY BE</b><br/>Raymond Chew, another MACEE employee, known principally for his extraordinary swag. </p><p><i>[J. HOLLIDAY]</i><br/><b>NO KICK-CRANK, 50-LITER TANK</b><br/>My motorbike has an electric start button so I don’t usually mess with the kickstart. More importantly, the Nissan Pathfinder my landlord lets us use has, ya know, a keyed ignition. </p><p>Most of this video was filmed in my landlord’s new house, across the street from his old house, where Nick and I live. My landlord, a contractor, is an extremely wealthy man, and this new house/palace he built makes that abundantly clear. </p><p>His rich dude swag includes eight imported cars for a household that has only three licensed drivers, one of whom lives in Sydney. I might second guess such extravagance in other circumstances, but since they’ve let us drive all over Malaysia in their SUVs, in this one case, I’m cool with it. </p><p><b>IT FEELS GOOD WAKING UP TO RINGGITS IN THE BANK,</b><br/>Most Friday nights I go to sleep around 9:30 so that I can wake up to ringgits in the bank nice and early. </p><p><b>PEREMPUAN IMPRESSED, DATUKS ON THE TEX</b>T,<br/>“Perempuan” = female. “Datuk” = a title given to prominent Malaysians by the state and national governments. </p><p>My landlord is a datuk (dah-toe), which makes his wife a datin (dah-tay). I send them an SMS when I need something. </p><p><b>AND I’M TEACHIN BAND FOUR SO I NEVER GET STRESSED</b><br/>Malaysian public schools are placed, based on test scores, into bands one (Harvard) through seven (willfully impeding the education of Malaysian children). Most ETAs are in band five schools, which would be atrocious by American standards. On the other hand, I visited a band three secondary school and afterward was considering enrolling myself, so the gaps between bands are pretty wide. Nick’s band five school could charge for jungle safaris through its hallways; kids at my band four school make hardly a peep when I ask them to do a worksheet on subject-verb agreement. If I do start feeling stressed, I try to remember how relatively easy I have it. </p><p><b>YO FRO MAYNE, GO MAYNE</b></p><p><i>[FRO2000]</i><br/><b>READY? HERE IT GO<br/>SHANMUGANATHAN FLOW THOUGH</b><br/>Mr. Shanmuganathan was the leader of the Johor ETA orientation. The ETAs loved him deeply. </p><p><b>I DIDN’T KILL YOUR CAT, I DIDN’T RUN IT OVER</b><br/>Lyric from an Obama Nation song that’s topped the Hot 100 in Malaysia. </p><p><b>FRESH, HIT EM UP</b></p><p><i>[J. HOLLIDAY]</i><br/><b>AFTER SCHOOL I’M SHUFFLIN</b><br/>Shuffling, LMFAO-style, is the most popular dance among Malay kids, who really aren’t supposed to be dancing. Islam and all that. </p><p><b>SO PK CO TURN REDDER, BUT I DON’T SWEAT HER</b><br/>Once, the PK Co (assistant principal for co-curricular activities) caught me shuffling with the kids after school, when they should’ve been saying their afternoon prayers in the surau, or mini mosque. I was discouraged from doing that in the future. </p><p><b>JUST SAY, “NEVERMIND!”</b><br/>In Malaysia, “nevermind” doesn’t mean “forget it.” It’s more like, “don’t worry about that” or “it will be okay.” A subtle difference that’s hard to explain, but it’s really noticeable, and Malaysians say it a lot. </p><p><b>AND CHEESE LIKE CHEDDAR</b><br/>Cheese, as in smile. It’s a midwestern phrase that I never heard during four years in Chicago, and then heard nonstop from the midwesterners at KL orientation. </p><p><b>MY MOE LETTER</b><br/>A stamped letter from the Ministry of Education is the trump card of the Malaysian school system. There’s no arguing with an MOE letter. You’re to do whatever an MOE letter says, exactly as the letter says to do it, and nevermind the facts on the ground or the cost or inconvenience or obvious detriment to the students. Your directions are right there, in black and white, next to the stamp. Now do it. </p><p><b>SAYS I’M PANAS LIKE M.I.M.S. BE, FLOW SO SICK I NEED A M.C.</b><br/>“Panas” = hot. M.I.M.S. was famous for that song “This Is Why I’m Hot.”</p><p>An M.C. is the note a Malaysian doctor gives you if you need to miss school for medical reasons. Or if you want to miss school for medical reasons. It costs 10 ringgit either way. </p><p><b>AND I NEVER TOUCH SOFT LIKE NAJIB.</b><br/>This means I couldn’t think of anything else to say. Also a reference to Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, famous for his soft hands. I shook one of them. It was like buttered silk. </p><p><b>(MUFFLED LAUGHTER)</b></p><p><i>RECORDED IN KUALA LUMPUR AT THE DORSETT REGENCY HOTEL, ROOM 1010, ON 17 MAY 2012</i></p>
