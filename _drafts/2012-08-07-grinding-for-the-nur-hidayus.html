<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1417482965091_3159">Unlike with the chickens, I got no quarrel with palm trees, and in fact they&rsquo;ve probably done less to upset me than almost any other living thing around. Not only that, but you can hire a man to bring his trained macaques to your yard and they&rsquo;ll pluck down your fresh coconuts for you. We didn&rsquo;t do that because when our coconuts were in season I didn&rsquo;t yet know there was such a service. Regrets, regrets.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1417482965091_3169">It is strange that there aren&rsquo;t any restaurants within an hour of here that would sell me a beer at any price, but it&rsquo;s not bad. I don&rsquo;t even like beer and I&rsquo;ve argued many times that—and let me say, I still believe this—that people who feel strongly about their beer probably account for many of the worst people in the world. Or at least many of the most grating personalities I&rsquo;ve ever chatted with casually at parties, and as far as I&rsquo;m concerned that group is coextensive with the worst people in the world. If you told me I could never drink another beer ever again—well, I don&rsquo;t like the idea of anything being permanent, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be so pressed.</p>
<p>But going home and being no longer able to walk into any restaurant and order a fresh coconut, that is going to suck. I love coconut juice and I love that you can ask the waitresses, who are uniformly tiny and attractive, for a coconut and they&rsquo;ll go fetch one from the pile, hack it open with an axe and bring it to you with a straw <em>and</em> a spoon, so that after drinking you may scrape out the meat and enjoy it, too. It&rsquo;s hard for me to believe this is really an option, it seems too kitschy to be real, like something you would get at whatever the tropical paradise analog to Medieval Times is; maybe a <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>-themed dinner theater. I get that feeling all the time here, often about the coconuts but not exclusively: Surprise that what I&rsquo;m seeing is a present-day culture and not some really extensive historical reenactment.</p>

<p>I know, things were said today on Twitter that didn&rsquo;t sound entirely positive but not to worry, this was one of my best days recently. There&rsquo;s one student in 4 UPSI, the third best class in Form Four and a dark-horse candidate for my favorite class overall, name of Nur Hidayu, and this girl spends every class smiling so hard I worry she&rsquo;s about to fall backwards out of her seat. She originally got in my good graces by lending me her neon yellow snapback when I didn&rsquo;t bring a hat to the track and field meet, but now it&rsquo;s the smiling that does it and today, after her team won a class competition, the joy of that victory, for which she and her teammates will receive small notebooks signed by yours truly, had her looking absolutely cracked out of her mind, in a good way. A lot of Malay kids are such jackasses but I long since stopped even bothering with them; now I&rsquo;m just grinding for the Nur Hidayus out there. </p>
