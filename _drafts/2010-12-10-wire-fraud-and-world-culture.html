<p><span>A woman in the newspaper office is out this week for a medical procedure, and while she&rsquo;s away I&rsquo;m assigned to read and respond to her e-mail.  I don&rsquo;t know if she subscribes to the</span><a href="https://lists.uchicago.edu/web/info/next-of-kin_of_recently_deceased_Nigerian_royalty" target="_self"> [Next-of-kin_of_recently_deceased_Nigerian_royalty] listhost</a><span>, but it seems like she might because this lady receives an inordinate number of scam e-mails.  Every ten or twelve minutes, like clockwork, her Microsoft Outlook </span><em>dings</em><span> with a message from another sub-Saharan duke or dauphin who somehow wrangled 45,000,000GBP and, naturally enough, is now angling to split that shit fifty-fifty with some mid-level American office worker</span><em>.</em></p>

<p>[Like most folks, I knew about this Nigerian advance-fee fraud already, but spending a couple days reading the woman&rsquo;s e-mail has introduced me to a few obscure scams that have yet to blow up and turn pop.  My favorite by far is when the sender supposedly wants to advertise a litter of free puppies in your publication.  (If you don&rsquo;t work at a publication, then breathe easy, this one&rsquo;s no threat to you.)  But sadly there are no puppies, and somehow the ad turns into a scam and a fairly compelling one too, because what could seem more innocuous than free <a href="http://jordanholliday.com/collections/writing/doggfather.html" target="_self">puppies</a>?  Interestingly, the puppies in question oftentimes are not purebred; today I heard from a man who needed to unload eight German shepherd–yorkie puppies.  In case you&rsquo;ve never seen one, a yorkie is more or less a yapping Koosh ball.  So on the one hand, imagine the hybrid vigor in these shepherd-yorkie fellas.  On the other, do you report that guy to the Better Business Bureau or the SPCA?*]</p>
<p>The art of scamming, it seems, lies in thinking of a ploy that&rsquo;s at once alluring and realistic.  I&rsquo;d like to get half of 45,000,000GBP of course, but every rich person I ever knew was a tight-fisted jerk, and I&rsquo;m egalitarian enough to figure rich people would be the same way in Nigeria, so that ploy doesn&rsquo;t seem realistic to me.  In the case of the German shepherd-yorkie mutts, what I really want to see is not those freak of nature puppies, it&rsquo;s the yorkie mom at full term.  I mean c'mon, that would be a sight to behold because that dog would be <em>way</em> swoll.  But the scammer is writing me when the puppies are eight weeks old and the mom has probably shrunk back to her standard size.  You tell me where&rsquo;s the allure in that.</p>
<p>Now your cleverer scammers have made progress toward striking this delicate balance between practicality and appeal.  See for instance this offer received a couple days back:</p>
<p>––</p>
<p>Subject: FUNDS TRANSFER UNITED BANK OF AFRICA (UBA) 1-4 Walter Carrington Str.Lagos-Nigeria. From the Desk of MR PHILIP OZUOLA Highly Confidential. ATTN: Beneficiary,</p>
<p>Re:Release/Transfer Notice of your Approved Funds (US$800,000.00) eight hundred thousand united states dollar.May you remain favoured and I pray that this email will find you in Good Spirits and of course always in the best of health.</p>
<p><strong>This letter will definitely be amazing to you because of its believable value.</strong></p>
<p>Presently we are being paid by the WORLD BANK in other to avert Scam and also to avert beneficiary funds delays here in Nigeria,So far,we have succeeded in Settling (Mrs.Ann Kleyser,Mr.Edward Drake, Mr.Nelson Jones etc).</p>
<p>Your Funds were returned to the Federal Government Treasury some while ago because you did not finalize your claim for it. Dear Beneficiary Did You Send Them ??</p>
<p>––</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amazing to you because of its believable value.&quot;  It&rsquo;s like in middle school debate when we had to anticipate the other side&rsquo;s objections.  The discerning American recipient, having balked at innumerable other Nigerians who offered millions upon millions of dollars, sees this modest proposal and thinks, &quot;Eight hundred thousand?  Now<em>that&rsquo;s</em> what I call plausible.&quot;  I did ultimately turn down Mr. Ozuola, but in my response I made sure to compliment him on the considerable forethought evident in his letter.</p>
<p>That said, my compliments were given with some reservation.  See, the ploy here does a good job toeing the line that divides allure and believability, but the more basic problem is in the writing and editing.  This onslaught of transatlantic scam spam has totally shot the Nigerians&rsquo; credibility in America, to the point that no one wants to do business with them, not even those who, like myself, would otherwise be open to engaging in nebulous financial dealings with strangers met via e-mail.  And whether they&rsquo;re offering puppies or pounds sterling, these Nigerian grifters are easily recognized and avoided, thanks to their comically garbled English.</p>
<p>And look, I understand.  When I took Spanish in school my stock response to anything I couldn&rsquo;t comprehend (meaning most of it) was, &quot;Pueeeesssssss…&rdquo; and a shrug.  That translates roughly to, &ldquo;Well, who can say for certain?&rdquo; and few teachers consider it an acceptable answer to questions like, &ldquo;Do you have any siblings?&quot;  So I totally get the difficulty of using a foreign language.</p>
<p>Which is why I&rsquo;m extending my own offer to any Nigerian scammer who takes me up.  <strong>Scammers</strong>, let me copy edit your schemes.  Before sending your letters to potential marks, send them to me and I&rsquo;ll give them a once-over, clean up any mistakes in spelling and diction, and if necessary, suggest a more feasible pairing of dog breeds than the one you chose.  Chow Chow and English Coonhound.  That&rsquo;s one freebie, and I spent this afternoon writing down literally hundreds of other possible combinations so I&rsquo;ve got plenty more where that came from, you just e-mail me and ask.</p>
<p>There are millions of credulous e-mail users waiting for some polite, well-spoken, not-obviously-Nigerian stranger to come along and make them victims of small-time wire fraud, and between my native fluency in English and your lack of scruples, we can make that happen.  We Americans are fundamentally an isolationist, kinda-sorta-vaguely-xenophobic lot, and when we get bilked we want our money to support local illegitimate business, not some rando foreign concern.  While I don&rsquo;t endorse this insular mindset, you do have to cater to the realities of the marketplace, which is why you need someone like me who can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-xAipYRAI" target="_self">speak tremendous Americano</a> and make you sound exactly like one of us.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1417489659146_1582">Best of all, I&rsquo;m doing this pro bono.  You don&rsquo;t need to deposit funds for me in any escrow account or anything like that.  It&rsquo;s just that I think our evermore fractious world needs people building bridges between cultures, and I don&rsquo;t want anyone claiming on me that I didn&rsquo;t do my part.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1417489659146_1598">*<em id="yui_3_17_2_1_1417489659146_1597">Loyal reader MH points out that, supposing the yorkie were the father, this might not be inhumane at all, and in fact could be a credit to all yorkie-kind.  &quot;Something to which Yorkshire terriers everywhere might aspire,&rdquo; were MH&rsquo;s exact words. Which I guess is a fair point, dunno how I didn&rsquo;t think that through.</em></p>
