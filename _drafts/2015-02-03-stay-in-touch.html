<p>I got rid of my Facebook. Somehow I befriended hundreds of people with political and social views diametrically opposite my own (I guess I&rsquo;m a likable guy) and the psychic stress of logging in, only to find twenty new posts telling me how warped my opinions are, became more than I could take.
