<p><span>Like any true blue-state suburbanite, I&rsquo;m sympathetic to the plight of the American farmer, and have been ever since I read about it in a bestseller by a famous author. Of course, for most of my ilk, that bestseller was The <em>Omnivore&rsquo;s Dilemma</em> or maybe <em>Fast Food Nation</em>, but I like to claim I got in on the ground floor, since my entrée to the agri-intelligentsia was Jane Smiley&rsquo;s </span><em>A Thousand Acres</em><span>, and I read it back in the nineties.</span></p>
<p><span>That book starts off with the narrator describing how her family&rsquo;s farm looks to someone driving by at sixty miles-per-hour—tall crops, probably corn, stretched out to the horizon, unmistakably a farm—and in lieu of any physical contact with farms, I&rsquo;ve based my notions of farming on that description ever since.</span></p>
<p>At sixty miles-per-hour, I wouldn&rsquo;t have known the Green Earth Institute (a community-supported agriculture operation, or &ldquo;CSA&rdquo;) to be a farm, and I had trouble telling the wild from the sown even standing still, six feet away from a kale plant. Steve, who manages the Green Earth Institute, had fields that looked overgrown with weeds, like the fields in the utility right-of-way behind my house, and at a glance it seemed doubtful anything edible was growing out there.</p>
<p>Still, I take Steve at his word that some of those weeds would make a fine salad and that in fact many people pay for them, just like people pay for the corn off of my envisioned midwestern farm. My take-away lessons from my visit to Steve&rsquo;s farm were mostly in that vein: Confrontations between my conceptions and actuality, the much-mythicized American farm brought down to a level where I could touch and, in the case of one pilfered lettuce leaf, taste it.</p>
<p>The broadest of those conceptions, the one that largely frames my approach to this class and to our trip, is that throughout much of the world, farming is broken. Most places, it&rsquo;s an unsustainable system of chemical inputs that grows larger and less- sustainable along with the world&rsquo;s population. And where people have addressed those issues, they&rsquo;ve done so in ways that work for Whole Foods&rsquo; clientele, but not for people in Appalachia or on Chicago&rsquo;s south side or for many of the farmers themselves.</p>
<p>In a way, it was cheering and reaffirming to hear Steve and Mike (who runs an industrial corn-and-soybean farm) address us in the context of those problems, and both did so without much prompting. Steve didn&rsquo;t speak long before arriving at the importance of farming in accordance with nature, which is to say farming as he farms, and Mike had a folder of relevant reading on hand and Blake Hurst&rsquo;s arguments (which defend industrial farming techniques) in mind. Both were aware of the debate surrounding farming these days, and both correctly figured that debate had a lot to do with our visit (I&rsquo;ll reluctantly admit, I expected this less from the industrial farmer, Mike).</p>
<p>In my conception, the solution to the farming problems that are on our minds and, evidently, not far from the farmers&rsquo;, lies in some sort of compromise. Mike and Steve both described strong moral imperatives behind their work—for Mike, the need to feed people, and for Steve, the need to do so sustainably—and surely (I thought) they would understand that were they both to make some concessions, they would both fulfill their respective goals more nearly than they will by simply tugging away at opposite ends of the same rope. What those concessions would be and how they would be negotiated is the sticking point, but I assumed the necessity of a compromise, whatever shape it might take, was beyond question.</p>
<p>Besides that, it seems natural to me that Mike and Steve and others like them would be the ones hammering out that compromise. They are the agricultural missionaries, the farm board members, the people with the interest and the know-how to determine what&rsquo;s feasible and then, most importantly, implement on their own farms the compromise that will fix farming. So I figured.</p>
<p>But again, that conception of mine wasn&rsquo;t much evident in the way they spoke. I found it interesting that these two men, who work at the very nexus of this food and farming discussion, weren&rsquo;t nearly as confused by the situation as I am. The questions we face about food production seem to me fantastically complex and likely irresolvable without major physical and philosophical concessions from both sides; but neither Steve nor Mike spoke like he needed to concede much of anything. Divergent as their approaches to farming were, each seemed to believe he had, if not the only answer, then the most practical and ethical answer to the question, &ldquo;How ought humans feed themselves?&rdquo; For all the debate swirling about them, the two were true believers in their methodologies.</p>
<p>Again, my conceptions were butting against the actual workings of the farms. When Mike, Steve, and Martin (Steve&rsquo;s assistant) told our class what a day&rsquo;s work means for each of them, my only thought was that running a farm sounds very, very hard, and not a whit so romantic as Wendell Berry would have me believe. The intricacies of the operations, even the organic operation with its 40 varieties of crops and checklists of regulations to follow, left me winded just from hearing about them. Add to that the financial uncertainties they face—particularly “industrial farmer” Mike, who mentioned that he often took losses on his crops, despite all the chemical measures he undertakes to ensure successful growing seasons—plus their side jobs, like selling seed and making presentations, and I reach a point where I can&rsquo;t envision them assuming any further responsibility.</p>
<p>And yet, in my conception, these are the people responsible for fixing farming. That&rsquo;s a tall order to ascribe to anyone, and in Mike&rsquo;s case, the public has foisted it upon him well after he chose to be a farmer. I think, having heard him speak, Mike has headaches enough without assuming the further magnitudes of risk and uncertainty necessary to bring his farm into compliance with the policy proposals Michael Pollan lays out in a few keystrokes.</p>
<p>As much as I am broadly sympathetic to Pollan&rsquo;s position, after seeing the complexity of Mike&rsquo;s operation and the investment of time, money, and emotion needed to maintain it, I can see how he would balk at Pollan&rsquo;s writing. Pollan&rsquo;s model of farming is often at odds with what Mike does, but I bet one of the most galling aspects of Pollan&rsquo;s argument is its relative tidiness. It&rsquo;s as if Pollan has connected all the dots— we save the Earth, improve our health, and strengthen our government in one fell swoop. And myself, I think Pollan is mostly right, and Hurst mostly isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But even so, Pollan&rsquo;s reforms would mean chaos for corn-and-soybean men like Mike, a complete upheaval in the way they make their livelihood. And if sustainable agriculture were even more efficient and mainstream, it might put a squeeze on small, labor-intensive CSAs like the Green Earth Institute, as well. In what I&rsquo;ve read, Pollan&rsquo;s cheery conception of the &ldquo;truly green revolution&rdquo; that awaits us, if only we have the wisdom to make it happen, totally elides these unfortunate outcomes; maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t move so many copies of the New York Times if it addressed them more fully. And until Mike the farmer and Michael the author see eye-to-eye on these questions, I think reform-minded individuals should think carefully about using the force of law to tell a fellow citizen how he may or may not work his land.</p>
<p>That makes me think back to Jane Smiley&rsquo;s <em>Thousand Acres</em>, and how that family&rsquo;s farm collapsed once it became more an intellectual and emotional battlefield than, say, a cornfield. In the book, it&rsquo;s the myth of the enduring, adaptable yeoman, who makes the best of all circumstances, that overlays a thornier reality; I think I was leaning heavily on that same myth when I expected Mike and Steve to be hashing out fix-alls for our farming problem.</p>
<p>Every bit as mythic, I&rsquo;d say, is the notion that there even are fix-alls available; this, I think, is Pollan&rsquo;s myth of choice, and the source of Blake Hurst&rsquo;s and Mike&rsquo;s frustrations. The transition to a more sustainable farming system will be miserable for many, not only Monsanto stockholders.</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-1edf9f2b-2b8d-0a99-745e-49631e63f509">Farms, being so far removed from most of us, are convenient places for such myths to take hold, and I think it&rsquo;s fun to romanticize and mythicize a simpler agrarian life. But like reading Smiley&rsquo;s book, hearing Mike and Steve speak was a reminder that farms aren&rsquo;t, in fact, one iota simpler, and looking for—or worse yet, finding—solutions to the farming debate within those myths only invites further trouble.</span></p>
