<p>I think afterward that cat ate the pineapple. Something sure did. Monitor lizards are also likely culprits. Those fellas will eat anything, including perhaps the cat, who&rsquo;s been real scarce since we came home from Vietnam. But I know better than to get my hopes up on that count. The cat&rsquo;s disappeared in the past for days at a stretch only to turn up on our porch, on otherwise unspoiled mornings, stinking of catnip and meowing for handouts and, often as not, knocked up with kittens I&rsquo;ll have to support out of my own pocket. And then Neek—who&rsquo;s partial to the ho mom-cat and got us into this predicament months ago by giving her some chicken chop in spite of my warning that he not feed the cats or show human warmth to the children, they&rsquo;ll never leave—Neek asks how come I&rsquo;m looking after those kittens one moment and praying for the mom-cat to be eaten by monitor lizards or carried off by macaques (known to happen) the next. Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you, Neek: it takes a heart harder than mine to deny a dewy-eyed kitten your leftover wax-paper package of nasi dagang, or a few kuih Raya when we have so many. No sir, not one single <em>got</em>damn kitten is going hungry on my watch, Neek, unless I have tickets to the Philippines. There is reason to believe the last batch of kittens starved while I was in the Philippines. Dust into dust.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1417482965091_3085"><strong>In other news</strong>: America, I&rsquo;m heartbroke. Ain, the younger sister of Intan, the lady who runs my school canteen, is going back to college tomorrow. Before she thought she had two more weeks after the Hari Raya break, but no, she&rsquo;s gone tomorrow and I&rsquo;ll never see her again. Ain was one of the only good things about my first few days of school. There&rsquo;s a certain subset of Malay girls who dress way hipster—whether that&rsquo;s intentional or out of actual poverty is impossible to say—and Ain is one, which needless to say I appreciate. On top of that (as if she needed anything more!) she speaks English well and fixes me weird drinks like ice water without much fuss. We originally met while she was working the cash register and I was paying for my morning chicken rice. The first questions Ain asked me were the typical ones, if I had a girlfriend and if I wanted her to be my girlfriend, and I politely declined, but in another life, where I&rsquo;m a practicing Muslim interested in relocating to freaking rural Malaysia&hellip; but why speculate? I bought her a pack of kuih potong to remember me by. Should&rsquo;ve chosen something non-perishable. Fuck.</p>
