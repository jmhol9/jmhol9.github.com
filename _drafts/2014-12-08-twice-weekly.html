<p><span>About twice weekly I get a moment where I catch myself thinking: <em>One day I&rsquo;m not gonna have to abide this bullshit no more</em>. All the crowds. The bustle and the noise. The expectations. The tattooed stockgirl at the organic grocer looking at me askance, real judgmental like, when I ask her where they keep the Cool Ranch Doritos. Type of person can&rsquo;t appreciate Cool Ranch Doritos?</span><br/><br/><span>Not my type, that&rsquo;s for damn certain.</span><br/><br/><span>Nah. I&rsquo;m gonna get out of here, one day. Settle down on a little patch of land somewheres. Find a strong woman to tend to the fence-mending, the roof-thatching, the sock-darning, the dishes and the tidying up, various financial matters. I&rsquo;ll purchase a fleet of ducks to fill my days. Watch them drifting around the waterhole. Preening. When they&rsquo;re not looking I&rsquo;ll snatch a few of their eggs and follow a YouTube tutorial on preparing duck egg soup. There&rsquo;s gonna be a sign by my driveway that says DUCK X-ING, with silhouettes of a mama duck and some ducklings, but, it&rsquo;s no use. No one slows down. Sign may as well say, &ldquo;That bump you just felt was my beloved pet ducks&rdquo; for all that drivers pay attention to it. Well, no matter. My ducks can look after their own selves. They know to fly out of the way when the neighbor&rsquo;s F150 is barreling down on them.</span><br/><br/><span>A little peace, and a little quiet, and a modest collection of ducksâ€” one day.</span></p>
