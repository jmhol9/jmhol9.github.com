<p><em>I wrote this short story in July 2002, which would have made me&hellip; carry the six&hellip; 14 years old.</em></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1417570888695_2462">A clock by the door chimed nine o'clock. The door tinkled, a man entered, took a deep bow before the counter. &ldquo;Your subjects wish to see you, m'lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring them in!&rdquo; said the man behind the counter. He wore a golden crown and a flowing purple robe. His hair was dark, his skin tan and leathery.</p>
<p>A boy ran up and stood on tippy toes to address the man. There was no menu, as the man could recite all twenty-one of his flavors (plum, orange, banana, coke, kiwi, lime, key lime, mango, honey dew, cantaloupe, vanilla, tangerine, apple, pineapple, 7 Up, clementine, tutti frutti, fruit punch, fruit medley, wasabi, and the perennial favorite, lemon) at any given moment, and most of his subjects knew the flavors anyway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your majesty, I&rsquo;d like a medium lemon ice,&rdquo; said the boy. Scoops flew, blenders buzzed and syrup flowed as the man sculpted the boy&rsquo;s cone. He handed the boy the cone and accepted three quarters as payment. The next subject stepped up to the throne and the process repeated itself.</p>
<p>By 9:15 the castle was overflowing with subjects, and the man smiled. The counter was his throne. The shop was his castle. Queens was his kingdom. He was the King. The King of Shaved Ice.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>The King had a knack for dealing with his subjects. The King was fair—he had not increased the price of his ice in twenty years, and he had no intentions of doing so. But he was tough with them, as well, always demanding that his subjects order promptly and pay with exact change. Of course, people were willing to put up with this. Where else in Queens could you get shaved ice so delectable, so irresistible that it had been featured in Newsweek, the New York Times and on NPR?</p>
<p>The shaved ice was so good it had a Pavlovian effect on people. P.S. 203 in Queens had banned all references to the King because the bottom lips of his subjects began to quiver and drool ran down their cheeks whenever he was mentioned. Every U.S. President since Carter had visited the King at least once, and when Reagan became dependent upon the shaved ice to stay hydrated, he seriously considered checking into the Betty Ford Clinic.</p>
<p>Of course, people attempted to imitate the King. Six years ago, the Shaved Ice President opened a stand one block down from the King. The Prez, as he was known, operated his shop as a republic. His congress was composed of patrons who made business decisions, and his supreme court was immediate family who interpreted the business charter.</p>
<p>The Prez was able to compete for nearly a year before a series of filibusters in congress rendered him unable to choose new flavors and protestors picketed his shop after a five cent increase in all prices. When he botched the transition from a republic to an oligarchy, the Prez was forced to default on his debt and his shaved ice stand closed its lids forever.</p>
<p>The King also made short work of the Flavored Crystal Dictator, the Generalissimo of Snow Cones and the High Priestess of Frozen Delights. Nobody could compete with the King. That is until the Comrade rolled into town.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>The shop sprung up like a dandelion, furtively and under cover of night. It was just across the street from the castle, with stark white walls peppered with windows and two towers crowned by golden onion domes. A red and yellow banner on the outside decreed &ldquo;Snow cone lovers, Join the collective!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inside was cool, with a red carpet leading up to the counter where the Comrade stood. He was an imposing man, well over six feet and with a sack of potatoes for a gut. A thick, black mustache hung over his lips, bushy eyebrows over his eyes. His hair was short and neatly parted on the left. On the wall was a picture of the Comrade tenderly hugging a snow-cone-eating child. Beside the picture was a sign alerting customers that they had thirty seconds to order.</p>
<p>The King was taking his morning walk to work when he first noticed how imposing the Comrade&rsquo;s shop was. It soared above the other stores; its form unmistakable, its majesty undeniable. The King took a moment to admire the towers—they were vaguely reminiscent of some other building he had seen before, perhaps in a post card or in a textbook—but he couldn&rsquo;t place it. The shop&rsquo;s name was the Comrade of Peace, Land, and Snow Cones. Its logo was a yellow silhouette of an ice scoop intersected by a cone. The King walked to his store and put the Comrade in the back of his mind.</p>
<p>Business was slow for the King that day. It seemed that people were intrigued by this newcomer, the Comrade. No matter, thought the King. It&rsquo;s just a fad. In the end, the old favorite always wins. But the next day, business didn&rsquo;t pick up, and on the third day, the King&rsquo;s lull continued while the Comrade&rsquo;s store brimmed with customers.</p>
<p>The King found himself passing the next few weeks sitting idly behind the counter, staring off into space, his reverie only interrupted by the occasional subject wanting shaved ice. He tried to concoct some new flavors, but it was all for naught. Without the thought of giddy subjects rushing in to try the new flavors, the King just couldn&rsquo;t come up with anything. His mental menu remained unchanged.</p>
<p>After three days watching the Comrade&rsquo;s business boom without having to make a single cone himself, the King closed up shop and went fishing. All the waiting for customers bothered him, made him tense. He had developed a nervous twitch in his right eye and woke up at night sweating, feeling like he had just taken a dip in an ice flow. The King needed to relax.</p>
<p>And so the King spent ten days in a rowboat under a ferocious sun, squinting through a haze of mosquitoes and an eye that twitched like it was afflicted with epilepsy, while hoping for fish to bite. And the King spent ten nights lying on a mattress with lumps like small hills, trying to sleep while the teens next door had raucous keg parties and his eye danced an Argentinian tango.</p>
<p>Four hours on a Greyhound bus brought the King back to Queens. His nerves were still wracked, the twitch in his eye had apparently settled in for the long haul, and thanks to his fishing vacation, the King was now frustrated and weary. Upon reaching his apartment, the King sank into bed, but sleep evaded him once more. At one AM, he trudged to his recliner and passed the night watching an exuberant Tony Robbins tell people how they could harness their personal power for less than two hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Six AM came knocking, prompting the King to peel his ragged form from the chair and dress for work. He arrived at work to find a pulsating throng ordering coffee over at the Comrade&rsquo;s. He looked at his store, with the lights off, its tables empty, its freezer devoid of coffee flavored ice. The King walked over to the Comrade&rsquo;s store and went in.</p>
<p>He saw the floor sparkling and the King was jealous. He saw the crowd chattering, the same crowd that used to chatter in his store, and the King was irritate. He saw the Comrade, fat, prosperous, smirking, and the King was upset. He saw the menu, with all of its fifty-six flavors of ice, and the King was fuming. But then he saw the poster on the Comrade&rsquo;s wall, a caricature of a man wearing a purple robe, a golden crown, and a monocle that dangled from his forehead, kicking at several tiny children with snow cones, and the King was irate.</p>
<p>He looked up at the Comrade, who still work a smirk, but now stared straight at the King. The Comrade laughed. &ldquo;Hello, Your Majesty,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>His mind grasped for words, but the King found nothing. So he stood, trembling, staring at the Comrade, gasping for breath. At last, the King sputtered, &ldquo;This borough isn&rsquo;t big enough for the two us, Comrade. The King never loses.&rdquo; And he staggered out into the street, the mocking laughs of customers in the Comrade&rsquo;s store echoing after him all the way home.</p>
<p>The King could not sleep again that night. He shook constantly, trying to think of something to say to the Comrade, trying to think of someway to outdo him, but he could not. There was only one way to solve this problem with the Comrade—a showdown in the street.</p>
<p>The King sat down at his table and scribbled out a plan. Each man would have twenty four hours to make a snow cone to be submitted to a panel of judges. The best snow cone would win. The winner would stay, the loser would pack and leave town by dusk. There was no other way. Then he set out to find the Comrade.</p>
<p>He went to the Comrade&rsquo;s apartment first, hoping to find him there, but a knock on the door elicited no answer. He checked the windows—but the apartment was completely empty. No furniture, no decorations—and no Comrade.</p>
<p>The Comrade must have gone to work already. He&rsquo;d confront the Comrade in front of all the customers. They&rsquo;d be shocked. The showdown would be at high noon—when there wasn&rsquo;t a single shadow in all of Queens. The King would show everybody that he could make a snow cone better than some communist! He&rsquo;d show the Comrade once and for all that nobody can get the best of a monarch! Not a president, not a dictator, not a high priestess and certainly not a comrade!</p>
<p>But&hellip; that was odd. There was only one car in front of the Comrade&rsquo;s shop. And, much to the King&rsquo;s surprise, the Comrade was standing behind the car, haphazardly dumping cardboard boxes into the trunk. The King hustled up to the Comrade, a bewildered look on his face. &ldquo;Wh-where are you going?&rdquo; the King asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, you said it yourself,&rdquo; said the Comrade, &ldquo;this borough isn&rsquo;t big enough for the two of us. One of us has to go.&rdquo; The King furrowed his brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why&hellip; why you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Internal failures, mainly. A fairly complex blend of social and economic problems. I was unable to guarantee a consistent quality and quantity of my shaved ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&hellip; but&hellip; the showdown!&rdquo; cried the King. &ldquo;I had it all planned out. You and me. Best snow cone wins! What about the showdown?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;and then there was the unanticipated increase in spending for shop security&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was going to be epic. Fair maidens and brave knights cheering for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;and a whole series of poor sanitation reports and disasters with the kitchen equipment&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good husbands and goodwives praying for your victory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;not to mention a steady rise in alcoholism among my customers&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to author a book about the showdown. You could write the forward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;several mafia-like organizations gaining power on the board of directors&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be just like the wild west!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;and my workers who were supposed to keep order among the customers were the most corrupt of all, taking bribes, acting on personal preferences, abusing power in every way imaginable&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The winner takes all the marbles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;of course most of the employees were unhappy; they fragmented off and began their own businesses&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The loser leaves town by sundown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;you know, I just couldn&rsquo;t keep it togethere anymore. The whole thing collapsed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King frowned. &ldquo;So&hellip; no showdown?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope, I guess not. You win, Your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two were silent. Then the Comrade walked up to his shop, reached up, and removed the banner that had the interstecting cone and ice scoop on it. This he folded and tossed into the car. Then he removed another banner from his car and hung it over his shop&rsquo;s entrance.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1417570888695_2483">It was a white, red, and blue tricolor. Emblazoned upon it were the words, &ldquo;The Comrade of Peace, Land, and Snow Cones is No More.&rdquo;</p>
