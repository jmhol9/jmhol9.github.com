<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1417482965091_3121">My mentor and I broke fast last night at Sup Belut Kak Nah, a restaurant about ten miles south of me that&rsquo;s kind of an institution. Its name means &ldquo;Big Sister Nah&rsquo;s Eel Soup,&rdquo; which gives you some idea what sort of place becomes an institution around these parts. We both passed on the eel soup and got variations on fried rice instead. I finished my entire plate in about the time it took my mentor, Zira, to eat three spoonfuls, and then she asked if I was ready to go.</p>
<p>Now keep in mind that, prior to the evening call to prayer, we hadn&rsquo;t eaten in fourteen and a half hours. I was so hungry I would have eaten eel soup, if it came to that. Zira, meanwhile, barely touched her plate. It looked like she just shuffled around a few piles of rice, then decided she was done. Americans have to eat as much before it even dawns on us we&rsquo;re sticking food into our mouths. I asked how she could possibly be finished eating and she told me, by way of explanation, that she normally weighs 38 kilograms but, for Ramadan, has dropped down to 36. That&rsquo;s 79.4 pounds, whichâ€” I didn&rsquo;t know they made humans in that size.</p>
<p>Back in the car, Zira said she couldn&rsquo;t bear to wear a seatbelt, she was so full. Strange complaint from a lady who never bothers with her seatbelt anyway.</p>
