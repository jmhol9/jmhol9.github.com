<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1417482965091_3478">It was 10 or 11 o'clock on our first night in Cambodia and we were walking through Siem Reap&rsquo;s tourist district, when one of the tuk-tuk drivers ubiquitous in that part of the city approached me and, unbidden, gave me the full inventory of goods and services available through his particular tuk-tuk: &ldquo;Tuktuk<em>massage</em>shootingrange<em>mareeeejuana</em>chickenfarm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Struck, I turned to the person next to me and said, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that interesting? It&rsquo;s coming up on midnight and they&rsquo;re still offering tours of the chicken farm. Such dedication.</p>
<p>&quot;And I bet it&rsquo;s a cool tour, too. I mean, people here eat a lot of chicken. That&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s actually important to Khmer culture as it exists today. Not some temple frozen in time for the edification of tourists from overseas. The chicken farm. I like that. I wanna go see the chicken farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl walking beside me, an ex-pat who&rsquo;d been living in Siem Reap for most of a year, looked up, paused a beat, and then gave me the indulgent smile of a mother whose son just said he wants to be an astronaut and President and Tiger Woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you know what the chicken farm is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was then that I learned the thighs and breasts processed at Cambodian &ldquo;chicken farms&rdquo; are not the same sort you find on the menu at Kenny Roger&rsquo;s Roasters.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1417482965091_3498">Cambodia is not a country that makes a good first impression, the enthusiasm of my last post notwithstanding. The first person you meet after passing through customs will probably be a cabbie, and he will definitely be trying to gouge you of all those dollars you just took out of the ATM. And that&rsquo;s only the start. If you are a man of any age and as obviously foreign as I was, 80 percent of the Cambodians you encounter will be trying to sell you something, often drugs or sex. Those not pushing vice are generally selling things that are legal, at prices so high they shouldn&rsquo;t be. Everyone&rsquo;s got a hustle</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/uQuuBGn.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>This girl had so much hustle. She sold us four wooden bead bracelets (street value: 12 cents) for $4 at a food stand in Angkor.</em></p>
<p>To me, that was the worst of Cambodia. There&rsquo;s also the dirt, noise, open sewers, generally crumbling infrastructure, and cross-country buses that break down at 2 a.m. and leave Jake to curl up for the night on the doorstep of some shuttered bodega. But all that is kinda fun. It adds to the illusion you&rsquo;re retracing the steps of Indiana Jones or Lara Croft.</p>
<p>The hustling I can&rsquo;t stand though. I feel very confident in saying that when a Cambodian visits the United States, the average American he meets is not trying to cheat him out of his money. The typical Cambodian you meet as an American <em>will</em> be some dude trying to cheat you, or overcharge you, or shepherd you into a combination rub-n-tug and head shop, where of course you&rsquo;ll be cheated and overcharged.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s an argument to made that these tuk-tuk drivers and tour guides and shop owners are only sensible entrepreneurs charging what the market will bear. There&rsquo;s also an argument to made that anybody who says something like that is a bullshit apologist, that plenty of white people are traveling on tight budgets without stacks of cash to spare, and that shysters preying on the ignorance and uncertainty of others is surely no more acceptable among Cambodians than in any other culture.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a fraught debate. Hard to say which side I come down on.</p>
<p>Best as I could tell, I never got scammed out of anymore than a few bucks here and there, which is unavoidable. Two people traveling with us did pay $45 apiece for a day trip that later cost me and Jake $16 between us, which is like… $90 in Cambodia should buy you a controlling stake in whatever you&rsquo;re visiting.</p>
<p>So why put up with that? In this part of the world, I bet only Thailand and Indonesia get more tourists than Cambodia. Every year, millions of people fly thousands of miles to visit the country. As well they should. A trip to Cambodia is totally worth it, if only for one reason, and that reason is…</p>

<p><em>The great thing about jumping photos is that you can taking literally hundreds without inspiring murderous rage in your traveling companions.</em></p>
<p>No, the reason isn&rsquo;t Adeel Chaudhry. The reason is Angkor Wat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna try describing Angkor (the city is called Angkor, and Angkor Wat is the largest of the many temples still standing there), because I won&rsquo;t do it justice, and anyway Angkor isn&rsquo;t about words or historical understanding. Angkor is about the visual.</p>

<p><em>This is just a random temple in Angkor. You would round a bend in the road and suddenly there was another, looming in front of you.</em></p>

<p><em>Jake at the center of Angkor Wat</em></p>
<p>We spent three days wandering around these temples, and at no point did I learn why they were built, or when exactly, or why they were abandoned entirely. I had no context for most of what I saw, but that didn&rsquo;t make it any less spectacular.</p>
<p>And it was so totally different from how a similar historical site would be presented in America. Back home, you&rsquo;d have to stand behind a rope 50 feet from the temples. You&rsquo;d be escorted from the premises if you got any closer.</p>
<p>In Cambodia, you just wade through the little girls offering you small bronze Buddhas for one dollar, walk over to a temple and start climbing up the side. If you make it to the top, you can sit there, 100 feet above the ground, and dangle your feet over the parapet while you eat your tuna salad sandwich.</p>

<p><em>If you squint, you can see me and Adeel up there</em></p>
<p>Is there any risk a temple might collapse under the weight of all those tourists? Yes, definitely. There are ornately-carved stones all over the ground from where the temples have partially collapsed in the past. Notably, there are almost no pocket-sized stone fragments, presumably because those have all been carted off as souvenirs. I did find a couple, which I stashed in my backpack and now use as paperweights on my desk at school.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna be a stickler about it, I think that means I&rsquo;ve smuggled antiquities across international borders, but there didn&rsquo;t appear to be any rules in Cambodia, and since I was getting scammed left and right, I felt some ancient Khmer carvings were my due.</p>
