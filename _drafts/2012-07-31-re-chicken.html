<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1417482965091_3201">I know this blog has a substantial vegetarian following and though I have absolutely no qualms eating meat, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re so different, me and my vegetarian readers. I bet you guys are a lot like I was before moving to Malaysia: Don&rsquo;t know much about chickens. Never lived with one, to say nothing of living with many. Like as not you haven&rsquo;t given a chicken the back of your hand for trying to steal a fried fish straight off your plate, the entitled feathery fuck.</p>
<p>Yeah, that used to be me, too. But I&rsquo;ve been living with chickens for a time now and I can tell you with some authority these are filthy and tremendously stupid animals that inconvenience everyone living anywhere around them until the moment they are chopped, plucked, and put on a rotisserie. The males crow all hours of the day<em>and</em>Â have to be leashed to tiny stakes lest they drown themselves in the culverts. They&rsquo;re adorable, yes, straining against the little twine leashes tied around one of their feet, presumably wishing they could break free and go splash about in the open sewer, but that doesn&rsquo;t redeem them one bit in my eyes.</p>
<p>At this point when I go to the warong and order my nasi ayam masak merah, of the dead stuff they bring out on the plate I sympathize with:</p>
<p>the cucumber; the fried anchovies; the rice; the chicken</p>
<p>and in that order.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really expect anybody to start frequenting Kenny Rogers on account of my testimony but maybe there&rsquo;s someone reading now who&rsquo;s carrying unresolved guilt over chickens eaten, past or present, and to them I say: Let go. Unburden yourself.</p>
<p>These birds are not worth the anguish.</p>
