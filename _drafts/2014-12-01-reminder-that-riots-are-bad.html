<p class="graf--p"><strong>Gawker</strong>: <a href="http://gawker.com/actually-riots-are-good-the-economic-case-for-riots-i-1663629918" target="_blank">Actually, Riots Are Good</a></p>
<p class="graf--p">Rioting isn’t good, “actually.” The inclination to ennoble rioting, downplay its destructive impact, or characterize it as anything other than a horrible reaction to a horrible injustice, stems most immediately from the soft bigotry of low expectations, as they say, and more essentially from an inability to see places like Ferguson, MO and people like Mike Brown as anything more than another example you can append to pre-existing ideas about what’s right and wrong in the world.</p>
<p class="graf--p">The cult of the novel is strong within journalism and you can find someone to write anything if you promise him a few pageviews. For those of us employed as anything other than professional opinion holders, a clarifying exercise is to ignore the abstraction and ask whether this would seem good, or bad, for our own neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="graf--p">Would you want the police hassling people for walking down your street? </p>
<p class="graf--p">Would you want officers shooting unarmed people outside your home? </p>
<p class="graf--p">Would you want the strip mall where you shop to be looted and burned? </p>
<p class="graf--p">Would you like to lock yourself in your home and wonder whether the store where you work will be standing in the morning?</p>
